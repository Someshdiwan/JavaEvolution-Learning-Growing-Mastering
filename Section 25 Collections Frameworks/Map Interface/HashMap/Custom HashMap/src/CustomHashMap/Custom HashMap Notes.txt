extended version of the custom HashMap that includes:

- Iteration: Implements the Iterable interface so you can loop over all entries.
- Dynamic Size Tracking: A method (`size()`) returns the current number of key-value pairs.
- Load Factor Tuning: A configurable load factor (with getters and setters) and a constructor that accepts an initial
  capacity and load factor.

Extended Custom HashMap Implementation

Explanation of Extensions:
- Iteration:

- The class now implements Iterable<Entry<K, V>> and provides an inner HashMapIterator that traverses each non-empty bucket

- You can use a for-each loop to iterate over all key-value pairs.

- Dynamic Size Tracking:
- The size field is updated on every put() and remove() call.
- The size() method returns the current count of entries.

- Load Factor Tuning:
 - The loadFactor field is configurable through constructors and the setLoadFactor() method.
 - The resize() method uses this load factor to determine when to double the bucket array.
