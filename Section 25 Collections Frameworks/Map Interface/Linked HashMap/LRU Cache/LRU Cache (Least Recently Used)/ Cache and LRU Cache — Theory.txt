Cache and LRU Cache — Theory

1. What is Cache?
-----------------
- A **cache** is a temporary storage layer that stores frequently accessed data so it can be retrieved faster in the future.
- Goal: **Reduce latency** (time to access data) and **improve performance** by avoiding repeated computation or slow I/O operations.

💡 Examples of Cache:
- Browser cache → stores images, CSS, JavaScript to load websites faster.
- CPU cache → keeps recently used instructions/data closer to processor.
- Database cache → stores query results for faster retrieval.

---

2. Why Caching is Needed?
-------------------------
- Accessing **RAM** is faster than accessing **Disk**.
- Accessing **CPU cache (L1/L2)** is faster than **RAM**.
- Cache reduces the gap between **fast components** (CPU) and **slow components** (Disk/Network).

---

3. What is LRU Cache?
---------------------
- **LRU = Least Recently Used**.
- A cache replacement algorithm that decides which data to remove when the cache is full.
- Idea:
  - Keep the **most recently used** data in cache.
  - Remove the **least recently used** data when new space is needed.

---

4. Origin and History
---------------------
- The concept of LRU was first studied in **paging and memory management research** in the 1960s–1970s.
- It became popular in **operating systems (virtual memory)** to decide which memory page to replace when physical RAM was full.
- Later adopted in **databases, web systems, and CPU design**.

---

5. Why Use LRU Cache?
---------------------
- Real-world workloads show **temporal locality**:
  - If data is accessed now, it is likely to be accessed again soon.
- LRU captures this principle: recently used = likely to be reused.
- Helps balance **hit rate (cache effectiveness)** and **implementation simplicity**.

---

6. How LRU Works (Conceptual)
------------------------------
- Cache has limited size.
- When new data is inserted:
  - If not full → add it.
  - If full → evict the **least recently accessed** item.
- Recent accesses push data to the "top" of usage order.
- Old, unused data is evicted.

---

7. Applications of LRU Cache
-----------------------------

### 🖥️ Computer Systems:
- **CPU Caches (L1, L2, L3):**
  - Store recently used instructions and data.
- **Operating Systems (Paging):**
  - When RAM is full, OS evicts least recently used memory pages.

### 🌐 Web and Internet:
- **Web Browsers:**
  - Store recently visited pages, images, stylesheets.
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDN):**
  - Cache popular content closer to users.

### 🗄️ Databases:
- **Query Caching:**
  - Store frequently executed SQL results.
- **Index Caching:**
  - Speed up database lookups.

### 📱 Mobile Apps:
- **In-app caches:**
  - E.g., store profile pictures, news feed, or videos for quick reload.

### 🚗 Real-World Analogies:
- Your **wallet** acts like a cache:
  - You keep frequently used items (cash, cards) handy.
  - Rarely used items stay in a bigger "storage" (locker/bank).
- **Refrigerator**:
  - Keeps items you use often (milk, eggs) close at hand.
  - Rarely used groceries go in a deep freezer (slower to access).

8. Advantages of LRU
--------------------
✔ Simple and intuitive.
✔ Good performance for workloads with temporal locality.
✔ Used widely in hardware and software systems.

---

9. Limitations of LRU
---------------------
❌ Not always optimal → fails for "sequential scans" (where every access is new).
❌ Needs extra data structures (linked list, hashmap) to implement efficiently.
❌ Can be memory intensive for large caches.

🔑 Summary
----------
- **Cache** = fast temporary storage for frequently used data.
- **LRU Cache** = removes the least recently used item when full.
- Foundational concept in **computer science, operating systems, and modern applications**.
- Used everywhere → from **CPUs** to **web apps** to **mobile apps**.
