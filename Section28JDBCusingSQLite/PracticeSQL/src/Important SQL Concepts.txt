the most useful and important SQL concepts you should know for efficient querying:

---

SELECT Clause → Fetch Data  
   Retrieves data from a table.  
  
   SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
   Example:
   SELECT name, roll FROM students;
  
---

FROM Clause → Specify Table:
   Indicates the table from which to fetch data.
   SELECT * FROM students;

---

WHERE Clause → Filter Data  
   Retrieves rows based on conditions.  

   SELECT * FROM students WHERE deptno = 10;
   
   Operators: 
   -  = (equal), != or <> (not equal)  
   -  > (greater than), < (less than)  
   -  AND, OR, NOT (logical operators)  

---

DISTINCT Clause → Remove Duplicates  
   Fetches unique values.  
  
   SELECT DISTINCT deptno FROM students;
 
---

ORDER BY Clause → Sort Data  
   
Arranges data in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.  

SELECT name, roll FROM students ORDER BY name ASC;

---

LIMIT Clause → Restrict Number of Rows  

Fetches a specific number of rows.
   
SELECT * FROM students LIMIT 5;

---

JOINs (Combining Tables)
INNER JOIN (common values in both tables)

SELECT students.name, dept.deptname
FROM students
INNER JOIN dept ON students.deptno = dept.deptno;
  
-  LEFT JOIN  (all rows from the left table, matching from right)
-  RIGHT JOIN  (all rows from the right table, matching from left)

---

GROUP BY & Aggregate Functions → Group & Calculate  
   - COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN()
     
     SELECT deptno, COUNT(*) FROM students GROUP BY deptno;
---

HAVING Clause → Filter Groups
Used after GROUP BY (unlike WHERE).
  
SELECT deptno, COUNT(*)
FROM students
GROUP BY deptno
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
  
---

INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE (Modify Data)
   - INSERT → Add new records
     INSERT INTO students (roll, name, deptno) VALUES (16, 'Ravi', 30);
     
   - UPDATE → Modify existing records
     UPDATE students SET name = 'Raj' WHERE roll = 1;
    
   - DELETE → Remove records
     DELETE FROM students WHERE roll = 1;
    
---

Bonus: Use Indexes to speed up searches:

CREATE INDEX idx_deptno ON students(deptno);
