In SQL, clauses are components of a query that specify conditions, constraints, or instructions on
how to retrieve and manipulate data.

Here’s an explanation of key SQL parts used in your queries:

1. SELECT Clause 
   - The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database.  
   - Example:  
    
     SELECT * FROM students;
    
     This fetches all columns from the students table.  

2. FROM Clause
   - Specifies the table from which data is retrieved.  
   - Example:  
     
     SELECT name FROM students;
  
     Retrieves only the name column from the students table.  

3. DISTINCT Clause
   - Used to return only unique (non-duplicate) values from a column.  
   - Example:  
    
     SELECT DISTINCT deptno FROM students;
     
     This removes duplicate department numbers from the results.  

4. Error Handling in SQL Queries
   - Common errors encountered in your queries:  
     - Table not found: no such table: studetns (typo in the table name).
     - Column isn't found: no such column: dept (column doesn’t exist in students).
     - Syntax error: Incorrect placement of FROM.

5. Usage of WHERE Clause (Not Used in Your Queries, But Useful)
   - The WHERE clause filters records based on conditions.  
   - Example:
     SELECT * FROM students WHERE deptno = 10;
    
     Retrieves students belonging to department number 10.
