Type Erasure: As mentioned earlier, Java’s type erasure makes it difficult to retain generic type information at runtime,
limiting the usefulness of generics in exception handling.

Checked vs. Unchecked Exceptions: Java has strict rules around checked exceptions.

You can’t make a generic method throw arbitrary checked exceptions unless you declare those exceptions explicitly.

Runtime Type Information: Since exceptions are usually thrown and caught at runtime, the type of the generic parameter
will be lost, which might make generic exceptions less practical in certain scenarios.

Best Practices with Generic Exceptions:
Use generics in exception fields: Instead of making the exception class itself generic, use generic fields to store
error-related information.

Avoid overly complex exception hierarchies: Keep the use of generics in exceptions simple to maintain readability and
prevent confusion.

Type-safe exception handling: Always be mindful of how generic exceptions are used and caught to ensure type safety
and code clarity.

Conclusion:
Although Java imposes several limitations on using generics with exceptions
(primarily due to type erasure and runtime constraints),
you can still leverage generics in a limited capacity to enhance the functionality and flexibility of exceptions.

These include using generic fields, methods that throw generic exceptions, and handling various types of exceptions
while maintaining type safety.

Understanding these techniques allows you to make better use of Java’s generic features in advanced exception handling
scenarios.
