constructors. In Java, constructors are special methods used to initialize objects of a class. 

They have the same name as the class and do not have a return type.

If you were thinking about adding parameters to the class constructor, here's how you would do it:

What is a Constructor?

A constructor is used to initialize the state of an object when it's created. It can take parameters,
and you can use these parameters to initialize the object's fields.

Syntax for Constructor:

If you want to create a constructor that takes parameters (`int a, int b`), you would do it like this:

class Arithmetic {
    // Constructor that takes two integers
    public Arithmetic(int a, int b) 
    {
        // You could use 'a' and 'b' to initialize the object
        System.out.println("Constructor called with values: " + a + " and " + b);
    }

    // Method to add two integers and return the sum
    public int add(int a, int b) 
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}

When do you use a constructor?

- A constructor is automatically called when an object is created. 

- If you want to pass parameters to initialize an object, you can define a **parameterized constructor**.

Example with Constructor:

Hereâ€™s how it would look in your case with `Arithmetic` class having a constructor that takes parameters:

class Arithmetic {
    // Constructor with parameters a and b
    public Arithmetic(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Arithmetic object created with values: " + a + " and " + b);
    }

    // Method to add two integers and return their sum

    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}


class Adder extends Arithmetic {
    // Constructor of the subclass Adder
    public Adder(int a, int b) {
        // Call the superclass constructor
        super(a, b);
    }
}


public class Solution 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
{
        // Create an Adder object, passing parameters for the constructor
        Adder a = new Adder(10, 20);

        // Print the name of the superclass
        System.out.println("My superclass is: " + a.getClass().getSuperclass().getName());

        // Call the add method and print the result
        System.out.print(a.add(10, 32) + " " + a.add(10, 3) + " " + a.add(10, 10) + "\n");
    }
}


Breakdown:

1. Arithmetic Class:

   - A constructor is defined that takes two parameters (`int a` and `int b`). It can be used to initialize the object or print something.
   
2. Adder Class:

   - The constructor of `Adder` calls the `Arithmetic` class constructor using `super(a, b)` to initialize the base class.

3. Solution Class:

   - An `Adder` object is created with parameters `10` and `20`. This triggers the constructor in `Arithmetic` and prints the initialization message.

Output:

Arithmetic object created with values: 10 and 20

My superclass is: Arithmetic

42 13 20

Key Points about Constructors:

- A constructor does not have a return type.
- A constructor with parameters is called a parameterized constructor.
- In inheritance, you can call the superclass constructor using `super()` in the subclass constructor.
