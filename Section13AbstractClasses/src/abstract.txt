You cannot create an instance of an abstract class in Java.

Abstract classes are designed to be incomplete and serve as a base for other classes.

They may contain abstract methods, which have no implementation, making it impossible to instantiate them directly.

However, you can create instances of concrete subclasses that extend the abstract class and provide implementations
for all abstract methods.
