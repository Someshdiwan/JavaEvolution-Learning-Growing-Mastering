To reverse an array in place means that we need to reverse the elements without using any additional array or
extra space.

We can do this by swapping the elements starting from the two ends of the array, working towards the middle.

Approach:

1. Start two pointers:
   - One at the beginning (left = 0).
   - One at the end (right = n - 1).
2. Swap the elements at the left and right pointers.
3. Move the left pointer to the right and the right pointer to the left.
4. Continue this process until left is greater than or equal to right.

Algorithm:

1. Initialize two pointers left = 0 and right = n - 1.
2. Swap arr[left] and arr[right].
3. Increment left and decrement right.
4. Repeat the process until a left >= right.

Code Implementation in Java:

import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public static void reverseArray(int[] arr, int n) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = n - 1;

        // Swap elements while left is less than right
        while (left < right) {
            // Swap arr[left] and arr[right]
            int temp = arr[left];
            arr[left] = arr[right];
            arr[right] = temp;

            // Move pointers
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};  // Example input
        int n = arr.length;

        // Function call to reverse the array
        reverseArray(arr, n);

        // Output the reversed array
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));  // [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    }
}

Explanation:
- left starts at index 0 (the first element) and right starts at index n - 1 (the last element).
- Inside the while loop, we swap the elements at arr[left] and arr[right].
- After swapping, we increment left and decrement right, moving the pointers towards the center of the array.
- The loop continues until a left >= right.

Example:

For input:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

- First iteration: left = 0, right = 4 → Swap arr[0] with arr[4] → [5, 2, 3, 4, 1]
- Second iteration: left = 1, right = 3 → Swap arr[1] with arr[3] → [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
- Third iteration: left = 2`, right = 2 → The loop stops because left is not less than right.

The reversed array is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].

Time Complexity:
- O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array, because we are swapping each element once.

Space Complexity:
- O(1), as we are not using any extra space; the array is reversed in place.
