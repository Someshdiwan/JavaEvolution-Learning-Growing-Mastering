Collectors and the Streams API are widely used across various layers of modern software applications, especially in
Java-based back-end systems.

Here are some common areas where they are applied:

1. Back-End Data Processing:
- Business Logic: In server-side applications (like REST APIs built with Spring Boot), you often receive large
collections of data from databases.

Using collectors, you can filter, group, and summarize this data before sending it out as a response.

- Microservices: When processing data from multiple microservices or aggregating logs and metrics, collectors provide
an elegant way to compute summaries, counts, or group data based on different attributes.

2. Data Analytics and Reporting
- Aggregation: Collectors can compute statistical summaries (using methods like summarizingInt) that are useful
for generating reports.
- Grouping: Grouping data (e.g., orders by customer, products by category) is common in analytics tasks, and the
grouping collectors simplify this process.

3. Utility Libraries and Middleware
- Data Transformation: Many companies develop internal libraries to transform and clean data.
Collectors are used to implement such utilities, making code more concise and readable.

- Event Processing: In event-driven architectures, streams and collectors help in filtering and mapping events
before passing them further down the processing pipeline.

4. Front-End and Other Applications
- Desktop Applications:** While most front-end web development uses languages like JavaScript,
Java is still popular for desktop applications (e.g., JavaFX).

The same stream and collector techniques apply when processing user input or local data.

- Android Development: In Android apps, even though the UI is the primary focus,
processing data (such as filtering lists or grouping data for display) often leverages these APIs.

Conclusion:
Collectors are a fundamental tool for any Java developer dealing with collections of data, predominantly in
back-end environments.

They help create more readable, concise, and maintainable code by replacing verbose loops and conditional
logic with declarative operations.

Whether you're processing database records, aggregating logs, or preparing data for UI components,
understanding and using collectors is essential in modern software development.
