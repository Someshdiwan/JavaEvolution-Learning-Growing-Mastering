ðŸ”¹ Key Concept:
	â€¢	A functional interface = only 1 abstract method.
	â€¢	But it can inherit from another interface if the parent also has only 1 abstract method.
	â€¢	It can also inherit default methods and static methods without breaking functional interface rules.

ðŸ”¹ Explanation (for your notes later)
    1.	Parent interface
   	â€¢	Has 1 abstract method â†’ show(String msg)
   	â€¢	Has 1 default + 1 static method (these donâ€™t break functional interface rule).

   	2.	Child interface
   	â€¢	Extends Parent.
   	â€¢	Since Parent already has exactly 1 abstract method, Child can remain a functional interface.
    â€¢	You can override the same method, but you cannot add another abstract method.

    3.	Main class
    	â€¢	Implemented Child with a lambda expression.
    	â€¢	Used defaultMethod() and staticMethod() to show they also work with functional interfaces.

ðŸ”¹ Quick Recap:
âœ” Functional interface can extend another functional interface.
âœ” Must ensure total = only 1 abstract method across hierarchy.
âœ” Default + static methods are allowed.
âœ” Can override parentâ€™s abstract method but cannot add new abstract methods.
