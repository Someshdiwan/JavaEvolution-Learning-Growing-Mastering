In SQL, clauses are the components of a query that define its structure and behavior.

They help filter, sort, group, and manipulate data within a database.

SELECT – Retrieves data from a table.
FROM – Specifies the table from which to fetch data.
WHERE – Filters records based on conditions.
GROUP BY – Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns.
HAVING – Filters grouped records (used with GROUP BY).
ORDER BY – Sorts the result set in ascending or descending order.
LIMIT – Restricts the number of rows returned.
JOIN – Combines rows from multiple tables base on related columns.
ON – Defines the condition for joining tables.
UNION – Merges results from multiple SELECT statements.
INSERT INTO – Adds new records to a table.
UPDATE – Modifies existing records in a table.
DELETE – Removes records from a table.
