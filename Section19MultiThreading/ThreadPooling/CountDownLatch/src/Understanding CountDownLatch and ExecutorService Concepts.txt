Understanding CountDownLatch and ExecutorService Concepts:

Your code uses CountDownLatch, ExecutorService, and Callable, which are key concepts in Java Concurrency.

1. What is CountDownLatch?

CountDownLatch is a synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of tasks are completed.

Key Properties:
- It starts with a count (initialized via new CountDownLatch(count)).
- Each time countDown() is called, the count decreases.
- When the count reaches zero, the waiting thread(s) can proceed.

How It Works in Your Code:

CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3); // 3 tasks to complete
executorService.submit(new DependentService(latch));
executorService.submit(new DependentService(latch));
executorService.submit(new DependentService(latch));

latch.await();  // Wait until all services finish
System.out.println("Main");
executorService.shutdown();

- The main thread waits at latch.await() until all worker threads complete.
- Each worker thread calls latch.countDown() after finishing.

When to Use?
- To ensure that a group of background tasks complete before moving forward.
- Example: Loading multiple configuration files before starting an application.

2. What is ExecutorService?

ExecutorService manages thread pools, making it easy to execute tasks asynchronously without manually handling threads.

Why Use It?
- Efficient thread management (reuses threads instead of creating new ones).
- Prevents resource exhaustion (limits the number of concurrent threads).
- Graceful shutdown support (shutdown() method).

Types of Thread Pools:

| Method                                    | Description                                        |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Executors.newFixedThreadPool(n)           | Fixed number of threads (`n` threads).             |
| Executors.newCachedThreadPool()           | Creates new threads as needed, reuses old ones.    |
| Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()       | Single-threaded executor (tasks run sequentially). |

How It Works in Your Code:

ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

- Creates a thread pool of 3 threads.
- Only 3 tasks can run at the same time; others wait in a queue.

3. Callable<V> vs Runnable:

| Feature              | Runnable                           | Callable<V>               |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Return Value?        | No (void)                          |  Yes (V)                  |
| Exception Handling?  | No checked exceptions              |  Can throw exceptions     |
| Usage                | Thread, ExecutorService.submit()   |  ExecutorService.submit() |


static class DependentService implements Callable<String> {
    private CountDownLatch latch;

    public DependentService(CountDownLatch latch) {
        this.latch = latch;
    }

    @Override
    public String call() throws Exception {
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " service started.");
            Thread.sleep(2000);
        } finally {
            latch.countDown();  // Notify that this service is done
        }
        return "Ok";
    }
}

- Callable<String> returns a value (Ok) when the task completes.
- Runnable does not return a value.


4. Graceful Shutdown of ExecutorService:

| Method                       | Description                                                                    |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| shutdown()                   | Initiates an orderly shutdown (no new tasks, but existing tasks complete).     |
| shutdownNow()                | Attempts to stop all tasks immediately.                                        |
| awaitTermination(time, unit) | Blocks until all tasks finish or timeout.                                      |


executorService.shutdown();

- Ensures that no new tasks are accepted.
- Existing tasks finish execution before termination.

5. Alternative Approach: Using Future

Future<V> represents the result of an asynchronous computation.

Future<String> future1 = executorService.submit(new DependentService(latch));
Future<String> future2 = executorService.submit(new DependentService(latch));
Future<String> future3 = executorService.submit(new DependentService(latch));

future1.get();  // Blocks until task finishes
future2.get();
future3.get();

System.out.println("All Dependent services finished. Starting main service...");
executorService.shutdown();

- future.get() waits for the task to complete and retrieves the result.
- Useful for scenarios where you need the result of the computation.

6. Possible Improvements:

1. Use invokeAll() for Parallel Execution:

   List<Callable<String>> tasks = Arrays.asList(
       new DependentService(latch),
       new DependentService(latch),
       new DependentService(latch)
   );
   executorService.invokeAll(tasks);
   - Executes all tasks in parallel and waits for them to complete.

2. Use shutdownNow() if Immediate Stop is Needed:
   executorService.shutdownNow();
   - Stops all running tasks immediately (not recommended unless necessary).

| Concept           | Description                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
|  CountDownLatch   | Synchronization mechanism for waiting on multiple tasks. |
|  ExecutorService  | Manages thread pools efficiently.                        |
|  FixedThreadPool  | Limits the number of concurrent threads.                 |
|  Callable<V>      | Allows tasks to return a result.                         |
|  Future<V>        | Handles asynchronous task results.                       |
|  shutdown()       | Gracefully stops an ExecutorService.                     |


import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class FixProblemInExecuterServices {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        int numberOfServices = 3;
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numberOfServices);
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(numberOfServices);

        Future<String> future1 = executorService.submit(new DependentService(latch));
        Future<String> future2 = executorService.submit(new DependentService(latch));
        Future<String> future3 = executorService.submit(new DependentService(latch));

        // Wait for all tasks
        latch.await();

        System.out.println("All Dependent services finished. Starting main service...");

        // Retrieve results (optional)
        System.out.println(future1.get());
        System.out.println(future2.get());
        System.out.println(future3.get());

        executorService.shutdown();
    }

    static class DependentService implements Callable<String> {
        private CountDownLatch latch;

        public DependentService(CountDownLatch latch) {
            this.latch = latch;
        }

        @Override
        public String call() throws Exception {
            try {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " service started.");
                Thread.sleep(2000);
            } finally {
                latch.countDown();
            }
            return "Ok";
        }
    }
}

Key Takeaways:
1. Use `CountDownLatch` for waiting on multiple tasks.
2. Use `ExecutorService` to manage thread pools efficiently.
3. Use `Callable<String>` when tasks return results.
4. Use `shutdown()` to stop the thread pool gracefully.
5. Use `Future<String>` to retrieve task results.
