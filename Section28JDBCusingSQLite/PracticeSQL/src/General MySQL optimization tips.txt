General MySQL optimization tips.

Here are some common ways to optimize SQL queries in MySQL:

1. Use Indexing Properly
Ensure that frequently used columns in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses have indexes.
Use composite indexes if filtering by multiple columns.

2. Avoid SELECT
Select only the necessary columns to reduce I/O load.

Example:

SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE status = 'active';

3. Use EXPLAIN for Query Analysis

Run EXPLAIN before your query to check execution plans:

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123;
Look for "Using filesort" or "Using temporary", which indicate potential optimizations.

4. Optimize JOINS:

Ensure joined columns have indexes.
Use INNER JOIN instead of LEFT JOIN when possible.
Avoid joining large tables unnecessarily.

5. Use LIMIT for Large Datasets
Instead of fetching all rows, paginate results:
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 100;

6. Optimize Subqueries & Use Joins Instead
Convert correlated subqueries into JOINs when possible.

Example (bad):
SELECT name FROM customers WHERE id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM orders);
Optimized version:

SELECT DISTINCT c.name FROM customers c JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id;

7. Partitioning Large Tables
For massive datasets, consider table partitioning to improve query speed.

8. Use Proper Data Types
Use INT for numbers instead of VARCHAR.
Use DATETIME instead of VARCHAR for date fields.
