In Java Generics, wildcards (?) are a special kind of type argument that can be used in method arguments or class
definitions to represent an unknown type.

They allow for more flexible and dynamic code by letting the type be specified later or be more loosely
defined.

Wildcards are useful when you donâ€™t know the exact type at the time of defining a class or method, or when you want to
allow a range of types rather than a single specific one.
