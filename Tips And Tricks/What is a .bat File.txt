What is a .bat File?

A .bat (Batch) file is a script file used in Windows to automate tasks.
It contains a series of commands that are executed sequentially when the file is run.

Key Features of a .bat File
- It is a text file with the .bat extension.
- Executes Command Prompt (CMD) commands automatically.
- Used to automate tasks like opening programs, running scripts, or managing files.
- Can be run by double-clicking or via the command line.

Example 1: A Simple .bat File
This .bat file prints "Hello, World!" and waits for user input before closing.

@echo off
echo Hello, World!
pause

Explanation:
- @echo off → Hides the commands from being displayed in the console.
- echo Hello, World! → Prints "Hello, World!" in the command prompt.
- pause → Waits for user input before closing the window.

Example 2: Opening Notepad via .bat
This script will open Notepad when executed:

@echo off
start notepad.exe

---

Example 3: Open IntelliJ IDEA via .bat
If you want to open IntelliJ IDEA and a specific Java file, use:

@echo off
start "" "C:\Program Files\JetBrains\IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2023.3\bin\idea64.exe" "D:\Projects\JavaTutorials\src\Main.java"

How It Works:
- start "" → Opens a new window (the empty "" prevents command prompt issues).
- The first path is IntelliJ's .exe file (updated to 2023.3 version in Program Files).
- The second path is a sample Java file (Main.java) inside a generic project folder on D: drive.
