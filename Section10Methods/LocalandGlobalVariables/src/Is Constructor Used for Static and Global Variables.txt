Is a Constructor Used for Static and Global Variables?

No, constructors are not used to initialize static (global) variables.

They are only used for instance variables. Here's why:

1. Static (Global) Variables Are Shared Across All Objects
Static variables belong to the class, not to individual objects.
Since a constructor runs only when an object is created, it cannot be relied on for initializing static variables.
Instead, static variables are initialized when the class is loaded into memory.

Example:

class Company {
    static String companyName = "Tech Corp"; // Initialized directly
}

The value of companyName is assigned once and shared by all instances.
If we try to modify it using a constructor, it would still be the same for all objects.

2. Static Variables Should Be Initialized in a Static Block (if needed)
A static block runs once when the class is loaded and is used for complex initialization.

Example:
class Company {
    static String companyName;

    // Static block to initialize static variable
    static {
        companyName = "Tech Corp";
        System.out.println("Static block executed");
    }
}
This ensures companyName is set before any object is created.

3. Constructor Only Initializes Instance Variables
A constructor runs when an object is created and initializes only instance variables, which belong to that object.
Static variables already exist before objects are created, so there’s no need to initialize them in a constructor.

Example:

class Company {
    private String employeeName;
    private double salary;

    static String companyName = "Tech Corp"; // Static variable

    // Constructor initializes only instance variables
    public Company(String employeeName, double salary) {
        this.employeeName = employeeName;
        this.salary = salary;
    }
}

companyName is initialized outside the constructor because it does not belong to an object.

Conclusion
✅ Constructors are used for initializing instance variables because they belong to objects.
❌ Constructors are NOT used for static (global) variables because static variables belong to
the class and are initialized when the class is loaded. Instead, direct assignment or a static block is used.
