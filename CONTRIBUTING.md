**macOS / Linux**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/Projects/"Java Se"
cd ~/Projects/"Java Se"
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
mkdir "C:\Users\<YourName>\Projects\Java Se"
cd "C:\Users\<YourName>\Projects\Java Se"
```

Clone your fork:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/JavaEvolution-Learning-Growing-Mastering.git
cd JavaEvolution-Learning-Growing-Mastering
```

Add upstream remote:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Someshdiwan/JavaEvolution-Learning-Growing-Mastering.git
```

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
