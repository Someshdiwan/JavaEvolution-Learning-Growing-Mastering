Definition & Purpose

A thread-safe queue that allows operations to wait when inserting into a full queue or retrieving from an empty queue.
Primarily used in producer-consumer scenarios.

Operations & Handling

Provides four types of methods to handle operations that cannot be immediately satisfied:
Throws exception: add(e), remove(), element()
Returns special value: offer(e), poll(), peek()
Blocks indefinitely: put(e), take()
Blocks for a limited time: offer(e, time, unit), poll(time, unit)

Thread Safety & Concurrency
Thread-safe implementation using internal locks or concurrency controls.
Supports multiple producers and consumers.
Follows memory consistency rules (happens-before relationship ensures synchronization).

Capacity & Constraints
May be capacity-bounded (restricting elements beyond a limit).
Always reports Integer.MAX_VALUE capacity if unbounded.
Does not accept null elements (throws NullPointerException).

Bulk Operations
Supports addAll(), containsAll(), retainAll(), and removeAll(), but these may not be atomic.
Shutdown & Termination

No built-in shutdown or close operation.
Common practice: use special termination objects (e.g., poison pills).
Usage Example (Producer-Consumer Model)

Producers add elements using put(e), and consumers retrieve using take().
Works safely with multiple producers and consumers.

Since & Author
Introduced in Java 1.5 as part of the Java Collections Framework.
Designed by Doug Lea.
