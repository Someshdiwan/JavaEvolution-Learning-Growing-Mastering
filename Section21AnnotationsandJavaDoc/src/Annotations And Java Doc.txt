# Section 21 – Annotations and JavaDoc (Quick Notes)

## Annotations
- Metadata that provides extra information to the compiler or JVM
- Common built-in annotations:
  - @Override → ensures a method overrides a parent method
  - @Deprecated → marks a method or class as outdated
  - @SuppressWarnings → tells the compiler to ignore specific warnings
- You can also create custom annotations using @interface

## JavaDoc
- Tool to generate documentation directly from comments in source code
- Special format:
  /**
    This is a JavaDoc comment
    @param x description
    @return result
   */
- Common tags:
  - @param → describes method parameters
  - @return → describes the return value
  - @throws → describes exceptions
  - @author, @version

## Why Important?
- Annotations help write cleaner code, reduce boilerplate, and are widely used in frameworks like Spring and JPA
- JavaDoc helps generate professional documentation and improves maintainability
