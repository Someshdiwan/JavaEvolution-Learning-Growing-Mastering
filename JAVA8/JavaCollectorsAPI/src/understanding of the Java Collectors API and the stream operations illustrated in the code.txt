list of questions that you can use to test your understanding of the Java Collectors API and the stream operations illustrated in the code:

1. Collecting to a List: 
   - What is the purpose of using Collectors.toList() in the following snippet?  
    
     List<String> res = names.stream()
             .filter(name -> name.startsWith("A"))
             .collect(Collectors.toList());
  
   - How does filtering and then collecting into a list work in this context?

2. Collecting to a Set:
  
   - How does `Collectors.toSet()` differ from `toList()` in terms of handling duplicates and ordering?  
    
     Set<Integer> set = nums.stream().collect(Collectors.toSet());    

3. Collecting to a Specific Collection:

   - Explain the use of Collectors.toCollection(() -> new ArrayDeque<>()).  
   - In what scenarios might you choose to collect stream elements into an ArrayDeque instead of a List or Set?

4. Joining Strings: 
    
  - How does the Collectors.joining(", ") method operate in this example?  
    
     String concatenatedNames = names.stream()
             .map(String::toUpperCase)
             .collect(Collectors.joining(", "));
    
   - What would be the output if the input list is `["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]`?

5. Summarizing Data:
    
  - What information does `Collectors.summarizingInt(x -> x) provide?  
    
    IntSummaryStatistics stats = numbers.stream().collect(Collectors.summarizingInt(x -> x));
     
   - What are the main statistical measures available from the IntSummaryStatistics object?

6. Calculating Averages:

   - How does Collectors.averagingInt(x -> x) work compared to summarizingInt?
  
   - Why might you choose one over the other when processing numerical data?

7. Counting Elements:

   - What is the role of Collectors.counting() in stream processing, and how is it used in this example?  
     
     Long count = numbers.stream().collect(Collectors.counting());
     
8. Grouping Elements: 
 
   - Explain how Collectors.groupingBy(String::length) groups elements from the stream.  
 
   - What is the difference between these variations:  
     - groupingBy(String::length)
     - groupingBy(String::length, Collectors.joining(", "))
     - groupingBy(String::length, Collectors.counting())

     - How does using a specific map type, as in groupingBy(String::length, TreeMap::new, Collectors.counting()), affect the result?

9. Partitioning Elements:
  
   - What is the difference between grouping and partitioning in the context of stream collectors?  
   - How does Collectors.partitioningBy(x -> x.length() > 5) split the stream into two groups?

10. Mapping and Collecting:

    - Describe how Collectors.mapping(x -> x.toUpperCase(), Collectors.toList()) modifies the stream before collecting.  
    - Why might you use a mapping collector instead of applying a mapping function directly on the stream?

11. Creating Maps with Collectors.toMap:
    
    - In Example 5, how does Collectors.toMap(x -> x.toUpperCase(), x -> x.length()) construct a map from a stream of strings?  
    - What will be the keys and values in the resulting map?

12. Handling Duplicate Keys with toMap:

    - In Example 6, explain the purpose of the merge function (x, y) -> x + y in:  
  
      words2.stream().collect(Collectors.toMap(k -> k, v -> 1, (x, y) -> x + y))
     
    - What issue does this merge function address when creating a map from elements with duplicate keys?

13. Reduction vs. Summing Collector:
    
    - Compare the two approaches used to sum values in a collection:  
     
      items.values().stream().reduce(Integer::sum)
      
      versus  
      
      items.values().stream().collect(Collectors.summingInt(x -> x))
      
    - What are the differences in terms of the return type and usage?

These questions cover a range of topics from basic collection to more advanced grouping, partitioning, and mapping techniques using the Java Collectors API. 

They should serve as a solid foundation for understanding and discussing the concepts demonstrated in the provided code.
