/*
Initial array:    [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
                     â†‘
                  insert 7 here (at index 2)

Step 1: i = 4    [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 10]  // Copy 10 to position 5
Step 2: i = 3    [2, 4, 6, 8, 8, 10]   // Copy 8 to position 4
Step 3: i = 2    [2, 4, 6, 6, 8, 10]   // Copy 6 to position 3

After insertion: [2, 4, 7, 6, 8, 10]    // Place 7 at position 2

1. Loop iteration**: `i--`
    - Moves backward through the array
    - This backward movement is crucial to prevent overwriting data

Starting array: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
i = 4: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 10]  // Moved 10
i = 3: [2, 4, 6, 8, 8, 10]   // Moved 8
i = 2: [2, 4, 6, 6, 8, 10]   // Moved 6
Result: [2, 4, 7, 6, 8, 10] // After inserting 7

The backward direction preserves data because:
1. We start from the end, so we're always moving data into empty spots
2. We never overwrite data before we've had a chance to move it
3. Each element is moved exactly once to its new position

This is similar to moving books on a shelf:
- If you need to make space in the middle, you start by moving the last book
- Moving books from right to left ensures you always have space to move the next book
