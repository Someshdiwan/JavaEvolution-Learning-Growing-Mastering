What are the things required to java program talk with the database program.
Ans: Need a driver
Need a connection
Need a statement(SQL).

In last Result Set.

Drivers: Helps the establish the connection. Using JAVA Program help to establish connection to the database.
it understand the JAVA And other database lang.


Driver will converted datatypes of java to the database of datatype.

Using the driver , We create statement using a connection and using this statement we write our Query.
Query is send via connection, to the database and it execute and results is return.

how a Java program talks to a database:

1. Driver  
   - Acts as the translator between the Java program and the database.  
   - It understands Java data types and converts them to the database’s data types (and vice versa).  
   - Using the driver, Java can establish a connection to the database.

2. Connection  
   - Once the driver is available, we use it to open a connection to the database.  
   - This connection is like a channel that allows us to send queries and receive results.

3. Statement 
   - With an active connection, we create a statement (often a Statement, PreparedStatement, or CallableStatement).  
   - We use this statement to write and send our SQL queries to the database.

4. ResultSet
   - When the database finishes executing our query, it sends back the results.  
   - Those results are provided to the Java program in a ResultSet.  
   - The Java program can then read data from the ResultSet row by row.

Essentially:
- The Driver loads and translates.  
- The Connection opens the link.  
- The Statement sends queries.  
- The ResultSet carries the returned data.


Short Explanation of JDBC Components
1. Driver  
   - Acts as a bridge between your Java application and the database.  
   - Understands Java data types and converts them to the database’s data types (and vice versa).

2. DriverManager  
   - Manages the different drivers available.  
   - Responsible for establishing a connection using the appropriate driver.

3. Connection  
   - Represents the actual link between your Java program and the database.  
   - You use this connection to send SQL commands and receive results.

4. Statement (or PreparedStatement, CallableStatement)  
   - Used to execute SQL queries (like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, etc.).  
   - You create the statement from the connection.

5. ResultSet
   - Represents the data returned by your SQL queries.  
   - Allows you to iterate over rows of data and read individual columns.
