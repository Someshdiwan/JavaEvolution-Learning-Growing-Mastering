Tuples vs HashMaps in Java:

In Java, there is no native Tuple type (unlike Python), but you can simulate it using custom classes or libraries.

On the other hand, HashMap is a built-in data structure that stores **key-value pairs**.

Although both can group data, they serve different purposes.

What is a Tuple?
----------------
- A **Tuple** is a collection of a fixed number of **ordered elements**.
- Each element can be of a different type.
- Tuples are often used for **grouping related but distinct pieces of data**.

**Characteristics of Tuples:**
1. **Fixed Structure** → Number and type of elements are defined at creation.
2. **Ordered** → Elements have a specific order, accessed by index.
3. **Lightweight** → Used to group data without creating a full class.
4. **Immutability** → In Python, tuples are immutable. In Java, custom tuples can be mutable or immutable.

**Use Cases:**
- Grouping related data (e.g., name, age, profession).
- Returning multiple values from a function.

**Examples:**

*Python Tuple Example*
```python
person_info = ("Alice", 25, "Engineer")
print(person_info[0])  # Alice
print(person_info[2])  # Engineer

Simulated Tuple in Java

class Tuple {
    String name;
    int age;

    public Tuple(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}

Tuple person = new Tuple("Alice", 25);
System.out.println(person.name); // Alice

What is a HashMap?
	•	A HashMap is a Java collection that stores data in key-value pairs.
	•	Keys are unique, while values may be duplicated.
	•	Provides fast lookup, insertion, and deletion using keys.

Characteristics of HashMaps:
	1.	Dynamic Structure → Grows and shrinks as needed.
	2.	Unordered → Does not maintain order of entries (use LinkedHashMap for order).
	3.	Key-Value Storage → Each entry is mapped from a unique key.
	4.	Mutable → Values can be added, updated, or removed.

Use Cases:
	•	Lookup tables (e.g., storing student marks by name).
	•	Efficient key-based retrieval.

Example in Java:

import java.util.HashMap;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> studentMarks = new HashMap<>();
        studentMarks.put("Alice", 85);
        studentMarks.put("Bob", 90);

        System.out.println("Alice's Marks: " + studentMarks.get("Alice")); // 85
    }
}

Key Differences Between Tuple and HashMap
-----------------------------------------

| Feature         | Tuple                                   | HashMap                                    |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Structure       | Fixed number of ordered elements.       | Dynamic key-value pairs.                   |
| Purpose         | Grouping related but distinct values.   | Mapping unique keys to values.             |
| Order           | Preserves order of elements.            | No guaranteed order (unordered).           |
| Access Method   | Accessed by index (position).           | Accessed by key.                           |
| Key Uniqueness  | N/A (no keys).                         | Keys must be unique.                       |
| Data Mutability | Can be mutable/immutable (custom).      | Fully mutable.                             |
| Use Cases       | Group related data (e.g., name, age).   | Fast lookups, mappings (e.g., names → marks). |
| Performance     | Lightweight, simple.                    | Optimized for fast retrieval.              |


When to Use Tuple vs HashMap?
-----------------------------

| Scenario                                    | Use Tuple | Use HashMap |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Group a fixed set of related values         | ✔ Yes     | ✖ No        |
| Need a dynamic structure for key-value pairs| ✖ No      | ✔ Yes       |
| Fast retrieval based on unique keys         | ✖ No      | ✔ Yes       |
| Access data by index/position               | ✔ Yes     | ✖ No        |
| Maintain order of elements                  | ✔ Yes     | ✖ No        |
|                                             |           | (use LinkedHashMap if order matters) |

Practical Examples

Tuple Example:
Grouping a person’s data:

Tuple person = new Tuple("Alice", 25, "Engineer");
System.out.println(person.name); // Alice
System.out.println(person.age);  // 25

HashMap Example:
Storing and retrieving student marks:

HashMap<String, Integer> studentMarks = new HashMap<>();
studentMarks.put("Alice", 85);
studentMarks.put("Bob", 90);

System.out.println(studentMarks.get("Alice")); // 85

⸻

Summary
•	Tuple → Best for grouping small, fixed, ordered sets of related data.
•	HashMap → Best for dynamic, key-based storage and fast lookups.
•	Both serve different purposes, and the choice depends on whether you need indexed grouping (Tuple) or key-value mapping (HashMap).
