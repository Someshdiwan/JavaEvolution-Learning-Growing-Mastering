In Java, ? appears only as part of the ternary conditional operator.

General form

condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false

It is a compact if–else expression that returns a value.

⸻

Simple example

int a = 5;
int b = 10;

int max = (a > b) ? a : b;

Equivalent to:

int max;
if (a > b) {
    max = a;
} else {
    max = b;
}

In the context of the earlier discussion

There was no ternary operator used in the last Java code.

This line:

cost += (sDigit - tDigit + 10) % 10;

does not contain ?.
It uses modulo arithmetic, not a conditional operator.

⸻

When ? is typically used
	•	Assigning values based on a condition
	•	Returning one of two expressions
	•	Compact logic where readability is preserved

Example:

String result = (x >= 0) ? "Positive" : "Negative";


⸻

When NOT to use ?
	•	Complex nested logic
	•	Multiple statements
	•	Situations where clarity suffers

⸻

Summary
	•	? is not a wildcard
	•	? is not optional
	•	? always pairs with :
	•	Meaning: “if condition then this else that”

End.
