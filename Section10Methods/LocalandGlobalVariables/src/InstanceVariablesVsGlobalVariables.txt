An instance variable is a variable that belongs to an object (instance) of a class.
It is declared inside a class but outside any method, constructor, or block.

Summary:

Instance variables store data that belongs to an object.
They are declared inside a class but outside methods.
Each object has its own copy of instance variables.
They have default values if not initialized.
They can be accessed using getters and setters if private.
