/*
The for-each loop (also known as the enhanced for loop) in Java is used to traverse elements of
arrays or collections in a simplified and readable way.

It eliminates the need to manage an index manually and works well when you just need to access each element,
rather than modifying the array or list.

for (dataType element : arrayOrCollection) {
         Body of the loop
         You can use 'element' directly in the loop
        }
