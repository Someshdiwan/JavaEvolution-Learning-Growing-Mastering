/*In Java, parameters are the variables listed in the method definition. They act as placeholders for the values that the method can accept. For example, in the method:

public static int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
Here, a and b are parameters. They define what kind of values the method addNumbers can accept (in this case, two integers).

When you call the method, you pass arguments (actual values) to these parameters. For example:

addNumbers(3, 5);
Here, 3 and 5 are arguments passed to the parameters a and b.

        In short:

Parameters are defined in the method signature.
Arguments are the actual values passed to the method when it is called.

        Parameters:

Defined in the method signature.
Act as placeholders for the values the method will receive.
Example: In public static void greet(String name), name is a parameter.
Arguments:

The actual values passed to the method when it is called.
        Example: In greet("Alice"), "Alice" is an argument passed to the name parameter.
Key Difference:
Parameters are part of the method definition (what the method expects).
Arguments are the actual values you provide when calling the method.*/
