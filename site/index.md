- [ ] **Scroll Progress Bar**  
  Add a visual indicator showing how much content the user has scrolled through on a page. This feature helps users track their progress while navigating long pages.

- [ ] **Search Bar for Topic Navigation**  
  Implement an in-page or site-wide search bar to allow users to quickly find topics, lessons, or files in the repository.

- [ ] **Styled Visited/Unvisited Links**  
  Enhance the site's user interface by making visited and unvisited links visually distinct, helping users easily navigate previously explored topics.

- [ ] **Dark Mode Polish & UX Enhancements**  
  Improve dark mode aesthetics by refining color contrasts, readability, and overall theme consistency across the website.

- [ ] **Improve PWA Caching & Offline Support**  
  Work on optimizing the Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality by enhancing service worker caching. This would allow users to access content offline more effectively.

- [ ] **Contributor Guide**  
  Add a comprehensive `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with clear setup instructions, task guidelines, and steps for issue reporting. This will make it easier for new contributors to get started.
