Below is the generated theory and code exactly as discussed:

---

### 1) What is use static keyword in Java?

**Use of static keyword:**  
When we are using the static keyword with a variable, block, or method, it becomes independent of the object.  
For example:
```java
class Example {
    static int a = 5;
}
```
Here, `a` is not dependent on any object. If we have two objects (e.g., `obj1` and `obj2`), both objects are able to access this variable. When we use static, it becomes independent of the object.

---

### 2) At which place we can use static keyword

Four places where we can use the static keyword:

a) **Before variable declaration**  
```java
class Calc {
    static int s;
}
```

b) **Before a block**  
```java
class Calc {
    static {
        System.out.println("this is static block");
    }
}
```

c) **During method creation**  
```java
class Calc {
    public static void add(int num1, int num2) { }
}
```

d) **With the concept of inner class** *(It is not discussed in this lecture)*  
```java
class OuterClass {
    int x = 10;
    static class InnerClass {
        int y = 5;
    }
}
```

### 3) When memory get allocated

For that we need to know some terms:  
a) Stack area  
b) Heap area  
c) Class loader system  

**Step 1:** When you compile the code you get a `.class` file.  
**Step 2:** When you execute (using `java MainClass`), the class is loaded by the Class Loader System.  
**Step 3:** During class loading, static variables are initialized and static blocks get executed.  
**Step 4:** Since static variables get memory in the heap before object creation, they are independent of the object.

### 4) Static variable vs instance variable

```java
class Calc {
    static int stA = 100; // independent of object; can be used by class name as well as object
    int inB = 100;        // dependent on object; can only be used by object

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calc obj1 = new Calc(); 
        Calc obj2 = new Calc();
        
        // For static variable
        System.out.println(Calc.stA); // use with class name
        System.out.println(obj1.stA);   // use by object name

        // For instance variable
        // System.out.println(Calc.inB); // error: Cannot make a static reference to the non-static
        System.out.println(obj1.inB);   // used by object name reference 

        obj1.inB = 1000;
        obj1.stA = 2000;

        // Static variable
        System.out.println(obj1.stA); // output: 2000
        System.out.println(obj2.stA); // output: 2000 (value changed for both obj1 and obj2)

        // Instance variable
        System.out.println(obj1.inB); // output: 1000
        System.out.println(obj2.inB); // output: 100 (no change in obj2)
    }
}
```

---

### 5) Static block vs non static block

- **Static block:** Executed before the execution of the `main` method.
- **Non static block:** Executed when you create an object and is executed before the constructor is called.

```java
class Calc {
    static {
        System.out.println("Static Block");
        System.out.println("Executed before main");
    }

    {
        // Non static block
        System.out.println("Non static block executed before the execution of constructor");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("main method");
        Calc c = new Calc(); // Non static block executed when we create an object 
        // Help h;         -- this will not execute static block of Help class
        // Help h = new Help(); -- this will execute static block of Help class
        Help.wish();         // This will execute static block of Help class
    }
}

class Help {
    static {
        System.out.println("Static block of Help class");
    }
    static void wish() {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}

/*
Output:
Static Block
Executed before main
main method
Non static block executed before the execution of constructor
Static block of Help class
Hello
*/
```

### 6) Static method vs non static method

- **Static methods** can be called with an object reference or class name, e.g., `ClassName.staticMethod()` or `objReference.staticMethod()`.
- **Non static methods** are dependent on the object and can be called only by the object reference, e.g., `objReference.nonStaticMethod()`.

**Remember one thing:**
i) We can use static properties or members inside non static blocks or methods without object creation.  
ii) But we cannot use non static properties or methods inside static blocks or methods without object creation.
