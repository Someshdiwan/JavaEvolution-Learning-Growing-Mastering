CopyOnWriteArraySet vs ConcurrentSkipListSet:

Quick summary
•   CopyOnWriteArraySet — thread-safe, snapshot (copy-on-write) semantics.
    Best when reads are very frequent and writes are rare. Keeps insertion order only
    as an artifact of the underlying array; not a sorted set.

•   ConcurrentSkipListSet — thread-safe, concurrent skip-list (sorted) set.
    Good when you need a concurrent sorted set with many readers and writers.
    Iterators are weakly consistent.

Practical guideline — when to use which

Use CopyOnWriteArraySet when:
    •   Your application is read-heavy and writes are rare (e.g., subscriber lists, configuration flags, event listeners).
    •   You need extremely cheap, lock-free reads and snapshot iteration semantics (guaranteed stable view during iteration).
    •   The set is small or writes are infrequent — you can tolerate the cost of copying on write.
    •   You want iterators that never reflect concurrent modifications (useful for certain correctness models).

Example scenarios
    •   Event listeners registry where listeners are added/removed rarely but invoked on every event.
    •   A small set of immutable configuration entries that rarely change but are read often.

Use ConcurrentSkipListSet when:
    •   You need a sorted set in a concurrent environment.
    •   Both reads and writes are frequent and you need good concurrency/scalability.
    •   You want navigation operations (lower, higher, ceiling, floor) and range views (subSet, headSet, tailSet).
    •   You can accept weakly consistent iterators.

Example scenarios
    •   A concurrent scheduler storing timestamps (sorted), priority queues, or indexes.
    •   Multi-threaded analytics with sorted top-k elements.

Pros and cons (quick)

CopyOnWriteArraySet
    •   Pros: simple concurrency, lock-free reads, snapshot iterators, stable iteration.
    •   Cons: writes are O(n) and allocate new array; not good for frequent writes or large sets.

ConcurrentSkipListSet
    •   Pros: scalable reads/writes, sorted navigation, CAS concurrency.
    •   Cons: more overhead than hash-based sets, weaker iterators.

Performance & capacity considerations
    •   CopyOnWriteArraySet: O(n) per write; extra memory for copies.
    •   ConcurrentSkipListSet: O(log n) operations; scalable for multi-threaded workloads.

⸻

Choosing by checklist
    •   Need sorted order / range queries → ConcurrentSkipListSet.
    •   Many concurrent writers and readers → ConcurrentSkipListSet.
    •   Read-mostly, tiny set, snapshot iteration → CopyOnWriteArraySet.
    •   Memory-limited + frequent writes → avoid CopyOnWriteArraySet.

Small conceptual ASCII contrast

CopyOnWriteArraySet (snapshot)
    Snapshot t0: [1,2,3]   <- iterator sees this
    Writer add(4): [1,2,3,4]
    Old iterators still see [1,2,3]

ConcurrentSkipListSet (skip list towers)
Level 2:  head ----------------> [50] ---------------->
Level 1:  head --> [10] --> [30] --> [50] --> [70]
Level 0:  head -> [5]->[10]->[20]->[30]->[50]->[60]->null

Concurrent insert/remove adjusts towers via CAS, iterators traverse bottom list and may see updates.

Example decision table
•   Many readers, rare writes, small set → CopyOnWriteArraySet.
•   Frequent reads/writes, need order → ConcurrentSkipListSet.
•   Sorted, single-thread → TreeSet.
•   Concurrent unordered → ConcurrentHashMap.newKeySet().
