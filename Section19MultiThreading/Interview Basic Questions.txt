Top 10 Java Multi-Threading Scenarios Every Developer Should Know! 🚀🚀🚀

1️⃣ Thread Pool Utilization Issue

💡 Scenario:
You have a thread pool of size 10, but sometimes tasks get stuck, leading to performance degradation. How would you diagnose and fix this issue?

👉 What strategies would you use to optimize thread pool performance?

2️⃣ Future vs CompletableFuture Challenge

💡 Scenario:
You need to execute multiple independent API calls in parallel and combine their results. Using Future forces you to block on get().

👉 How would you refactor this using CompletableFuture to achieve better performance?

3️⃣ Deadlock in a Microservices Environment

💡 Scenario:
Two microservices lock resources in reverse order, leading to a deadlock situation.

👉 How would you identify and resolve this issue? What tools would you use?

4️⃣ High CPU Usage in ExecutorService

💡 Scenario:
Your Java application uses FixedThreadPool(10), but under heavy load, CPU usage spikes to 100%.

👉 What possible reasons could cause this, and how would you resolve it?

5️⃣ Handling Millions of Concurrent Requests

💡 Scenario:
You need to design a real-time stock trading system that handles millions of concurrent requests.

👉 How would you implement efficient thread management and concurrency control?

6️⃣ Race Condition in a Banking System

💡 Scenario:
Two users withdraw money from the same account at the same time, causing an incorrect balance update.

👉 How would you prevent race conditions in this scenario?

7️⃣ Difference Between Parallelism and Concurrency in Practice

💡 Scenario:
Your application processes large datasets. Should you use concurrency or parallelism to optimize performance?

👉 How would you decide, and what Java tools would you use?

8️⃣ ExecutorService Task Cancellation Issue

💡 Scenario:
A long-running task in ExecutorService is taking too long, blocking the queue.

👉 How would you implement a timeout and cancel the task properly?

9️⃣ Performance Bottleneck in ForkJoinPool

💡 Scenario:
You're using ForkJoinPool for parallel processing, but performance doesn’t scale as expected.

👉 What factors could be causing this, and how would you optimize it?

🔟 Thread-Safe Data Structure Selection

💡 Scenario:
Your application requires fast concurrent reads and occasional writes.
