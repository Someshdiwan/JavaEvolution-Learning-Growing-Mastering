Executors Framework in Java (Thread Pooling) – Theory

The Executors Framework in Java is a high-level concurrency framework introduced in Java 5
(part of java.util.concurrent).

It provides a structured way to manage and control thread execution using thread pools,
improving efficiency and performance in multi-threaded applications.

Why Use the Executors Framework?

1. Efficient Thread Management
   - Reduces the overhead of creating and destroying threads manually.  
   - Reuses existing threads to execute multiple tasks.  

2. Optimized Performance
   - Prevents excessive thread creation that can degrade system performance.  
   - Efficient scheduling and execution of concurrent tasks.  

3. Better Control Over Threads
   - Allows limiting the number of active threads in the system.  
   - Provides various execution policies for different workload requirements.  

4. Simplifies Multi-Threading
   - Eliminates the complexity of manually handling `Thread` objects.  
   - Provides built-in mechanisms for handling scheduled and asynchronous tasks.  

Core Components of Executors Framework**

1. Executor Interface:

- The base interface for task execution.  
- Defines the execute(Runnable command) method for running tasks asynchronously.

2. ExecutorService Interface

- Extends Executor and provides advanced methods for thread management.
- Supports submitting tasks, shutting down the pool, and retrieving results.  

3. Executors Class

- A utility class that provides factory methods to create different types of thread pools.  
- Helps in managing thread creation without manually handling Thread objects.

4. Future Interface

- Represents the result of an asynchronous computation.
- Allows checking if the task is complete and retrieving the result once available.  

Types of Thread Pools in Executors Framework

| Thread Pool Type                                        | Description                                               | Use Case                                                          |
|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fixed Thread Pool (newFixedThreadPool(n))               | A pool with a fixed number of threads.                    | Best for executing a fixed number of tasks concurrently.          |
| Cached Thread Pool (newCachedThreadPool())              | Creates new threads as needed and reuses idle ones.       | Suitable for short-lived tasks with unpredictable loads.          |
| Single Thread Executor (newSingleThreadExecutor())      | A pool with a single thread executing tasks sequentially. | Ensures tasks execute in order, useful for sequential processing. |
| Scheduled Thread Pool (newScheduledThreadPool(n))       | Executes tasks after a fixed delay or periodically.       | Ideal for scheduled and recurring tasks.                          |

Advantages of the Executors Framework:

✔  Improved Performance** – Reduces thread creation overhead by reusing existing threads.
✔  Better Resource Management – Limits thread count to prevent excessive CPU and memory usage.
✔  Simplifies Thread Management – Eliminates the need for manual thread handling.
✔  Scalability – Adapts to workload demands efficiently.
✔  Flexibility – Provides different thread pool strategies for various use cases.
