Executors Framework in Java (Thread Pooling):

The Executors framework in Java (introduced in Java 5) provides a high-level API for managing thread pools efficiently. 
It is part of the java.util.concurrent package.

Why Use Executors?

Manages Thread Pooling Efficiently 🏭
Reduces Thread Creation Overhead 🚀
Provides Different Pooling Strategies 🎯
Automatically Handles Thread Lifecycle 🔄

Key Components of the Executors Framework

Executor Interface → A simple interface with execute(Runnable command).
ExecutorService Interface → Provides methods for managing threads.
Executors Class → Factory methods for creating different thread pools.
Future Interface → Handles asynchronous computation results.

Types of Thread Pools in Executors Framework

| Thread Pool Type             | Description                                          |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| newFixedThreadPool(int n)    | A pool with a fixed number of threads.               |
| newCachedThreadPool()        | Creates threads as needed and reuses idle threads.   |
| newSingleThreadExecutor()    | A pool with a single thread (sequential execution).  |
| newScheduledThreadPool(int n)| A pool for scheduling tasks with delays.             |

|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   Fixed Thread Pool  (newFixedThreadPool(n))           | A pool with a fixed number of threads.                       | Best for executing a fixed number of tasks concurrently.          |
|   Cached Thread Pool (newCachedThreadPool())           | Creates new threads as needed and reuses idle ones.          |  Suitable for short-lived tasks with unpredictable loads.         |
|   Single Thread Executor (newSingleThreadExecutor())   | A pool with a single thread executing tasks sequentially.    | Ensures tasks execute in order, useful for sequential processing. |
|   Scheduled Thread Pool (newScheduledThreadPool(n))    | Executes tasks after a fixed delay or periodically.          | Ideal for scheduled and recurring tasks.                          |

Advantages of Executors Framework
✅ Efficient Thread Management
✅ Avoids Manual Thread Creation & Destruction
✅ Provides Thread Pooling Strategies
✅ Handles Concurrency Smoothly

Advantages of the Executors Framework

✔ Improved Performance – Reduces thread creation overhead by reusing existing threads.
✔ Better Resource Management – Limits thread count to prevent excessive CPU and memory usage.
✔ Simplifies Thread Management – Eliminates the need for manual thread handling.
✔ Scalability – Adapts to workload demands efficiently.
✔ Flexibility – Provides different thread pool strategies for various use cases.
