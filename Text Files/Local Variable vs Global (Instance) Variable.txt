Local Variable vs Global (Instance) Variable

In Java, the distinction between local and global (or instance)** variables is essential to understanding how variables are used within a class.

Local Variables:

- Definition: A local variable is declared inside a method or block (like a constructor) and is only accessible within that method or block.
- Scope: It is only available within the method or block where it is declared.
- Lifetime: It exists only during the execution of the method/block and is destroyed once the method/block finishes executing.

- Example:

public class Example {
    public void myMethod() {
        int localVar = 10;  // local variable
        System.out.println(localVar); // Can be accessed within the method
    }
    
    // localVar cannot be accessed here, outside the method
}

```

- Key Points:
  - Declared inside a method.
  - Cannot be accessed outside that method.
  - Typically used for temporary calculations or as method-specific parameters.

Global Variables (Instance Variables):**

- Definition: A global variable is usually referred to as an instance variable in Java. It is declared inside a class but outside any methods. It is associated with an object and can be accessed by all methods in the class.
- Scope: The scope is the entire class.
- Lifetime: It exists as long as the object is alive and is destroyed when the object is garbage collected.

- Example:

public class Example 
{
    private int globalVar = 5;  // instance variable (global to the class)

    public void myMethod() {
        System.out.println(globalVar);  // Can access the global variable in any method
    }
    
    public void anotherMethod() {
        globalVar = 10;  // Can modify the global variable
        System.out.println(globalVar);  // Can access the updated global variable
    }
}
```

- Key Points:
  - Declared outside of any method, typically at the top of the class.
  - Accessible by all methods in the class.
  - Its value can persist across multiple method calls and instances of the class.

Static Variables (Class Variables):
- Definition: A static variable is a variable declared with the `static` keyword. It belongs to the class, not instances of the class.
- Scope: Its scope is the entire class, but it is shared by all instances of the class.
- Lifetime: It exists for the lifetime of the program.

- Example:

public class Example {
    static int staticVar = 100;  // static variable

    public void myMethod() {
        System.out.println(staticVar);  // Can access static variable
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(staticVar);  // Static variable can be accessed directly in static method
    }
}
```

- Key Points:

  - Declared with the `static` keyword.
  - Shared across all instances of the class (same value for all objects of that class).
  - Can be accessed directly from the `main` method (since `main` is static).

Summary Comparison:

|   Property                | Local Variable                               | Global (Instance) Variable                    | Static Variable                                              |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|   Declaration             | Inside methods or blocks                     | Inside the class but outside methods          |  Inside the class with `static`                              |
|   Scope                   | Only within the method/block                 | Throughout the class                          | Throughout the class (shared by all instances)               |
|   Lifetime                | Exists only during method execution          | As long as the object exists                  | As long as the program runs                                  |
|   Access                  | Accessible only within its method/block      | Accessible by any method in the class         |  Accessible by any method in the class or directly in `main` |
|   Default Value           | No default value (must be initialized)       | Default to `null` (objects), `0` (primitives) | Default to `0` (if not initialized)                          |

Example of All Types in One Class:

public class Example {
    private int instanceVar = 10;  // Instance variable (global variable)
    static int staticVar = 20;     // Static variable (global to class)

    public void method() {
        int localVar = 30;  // Local variable (only inside this method)
        System.out.println("Local Variable: " + localVar);
        System.out.println("Instance Variable: " + instanceVar);
        System.out.println("Static Variable: " + staticVar);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj = new Example();
        obj.method();  // Accessing instance and static variables
        System.out.println("Static Variable (from main): " + staticVar);
    }
}
```
Output:
```
Local Variable: 30
Instance Variable: 10
Static Variable: 20
Static Variable (from main): 20
```

Key Takeaways:

1. Local variables are temporary and limited to the method/block where they are declared.
2. Global (instance) variables** are available throughout the class and persist with the object.
3. Static variables are shared across all instances of a class and remain for the lifetime of the program.
