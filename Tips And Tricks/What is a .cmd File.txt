What is a .cmd File?

A .cmd file is very similar to a .bat file.
It is used in Windows to automate tasks in the Command Prompt.

Key Features of a .cmd File:
- Text file with .cmd extension.
- Runs sequential commands in CMD.
- Almost identical to .bat, but introduced in Windows NT.
- Preferred when using modern Windows scripting over legacy .bat.

Example 1: Simple Hello World
@echo off
echo Hello, World from CMD!
pause

Example 2: Open IntelliJ IDEA
@echo off
start "" "C:\Program Files\JetBrains\IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2023.3\bin\idea64.exe" "D:\Projects\JavaTutorials\src\Main.java"

How It Works:
- start "" launches a program in a new window.
- First path → IntelliJ executable.
- Second path → Java file to open.
