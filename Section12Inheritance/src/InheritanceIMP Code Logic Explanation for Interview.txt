Code Logic Explanation for Interview:

Your program demonstrates inheritance in Java, specifically:

- Encapsulation (private variables with getters and setters).
- Method Overriding (different implementations of deposit, withdraw, and repay).
- Polymorphism (SavingsAccount and LoanAccount extending Account).

---

1. Base Class: `Account`
     
     - This is a superclass containing attributes for:
     - Account number (`accNo`)
     - Name (`name`)
     - Address (`address`)
     - Phone number (`phno`)
     - Date of Birth (`dob`)
     - Balance (`balance`, protected so subclasses can modify it)
     - It has a constructor to initialize all these attributes.
     - It provides getter methods for account details.
     - Setter methods allow updating `address` and `phno`.

2.  Subclass: `SavingsAccount` (Regular Bank Account):

   - Extends `Account`, meaning it inherits all properties of `Account`.
   - Implements deposit() and withdraw() methods.
   - Withdrawal is restricted (prevents overdrawing).

3. Subclass: `LoanAccount` (Credit/Debt System):
   
   - Also extends `Account`, but balance here represents debt.
   - Implements payEMI() and repay():
   - `payEMI()` reduces debt partially.
   - `repay()` allows paying off the entire loan.
   - Ensures debt does not go negative.

4. Main Class (`InheritanceIMP`):
   
   - Creates a `SavingsAccount` and `LoanAccount` object.
   - Tests `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, `payEMI()`, and `repay()`.
   - Prints results to verify the implementation.

How to Explain System Design in Interviews:

System design focuses on scalability, performance, and reliability. Interviewers expect you to:
1. Understand requirements (functional & non-functional).
2. Break down components (databases, APIs, microservices, etc.).
3. Consider trade-offs (scalability vs. consistency).
4. Optimize for performance (caching, load balancing).

Basic Concepts to Cover:

✅ OOP Principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction.  
✅ SOLID Principles: Ensuring scalable and maintainable code.  
✅ Multithreading & Concurrency: Handling multiple processes efficiently.  
✅ Design Patterns: Factory, Singleton, Observer, etc.  
✅ Database Design: Normalization, Indexing, SQL vs NoSQL.  
✅ Microservices & REST APIs: How to design scalable web applications.  
✅ Caching & Load Balancing: Redis, CDN, and other optimizations.
