Short Summary:
BlockingQueue<E> is a thread-safe queue that supports operations that wait for space availability when
inserting elements and for non-empty conditions when retrieving them. It provides four types of methods for
handling operations: throwing exceptions, returning special values, blocking indefinitely, and blocking for
a limited time. BlockingQueue is primarily used for producer-consumer scenarios, does not accept null elements,
and may be capacity-bounded. It does not support intrinsic shutdown operations but can use special end-of-stream
objects for termination. Memory consistency is ensured through the happens-before principle.

Medium Summary:
BlockingQueue<E> is an interface in java.util.concurrent that extends Queue<E> with additional methods for
handling concurrent producer-consumer scenarios. It allows elements to be added or retrieved while managing
blocking conditions when the queue is full or empty. Operations can either throw exceptions, return special values,
block indefinitely, or block for a specified time. BlockingQueue does not accept null elements, ensuring robustness in
concurrent environments. It may have a bounded capacity and provides thread safety using internal locks or concurrency
controls. While it supports bulk operations from Collection, they may not be atomic. Unlike traditional queues,
it lacks a built-in shutdown mechanism, but producers can insert special termination objects. The interface follows
memory consistency rules, ensuring proper synchronization between threads.
