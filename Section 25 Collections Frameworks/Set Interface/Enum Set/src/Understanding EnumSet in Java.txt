Understanding EnumSet in Java

## What is EnumSet?

- A **specialized Set implementation** designed exclusively for use with **enum types**.
- Part of the `java.util` package.
- Provides a **highly efficient, compact, and type-safe** way to store enum constants.
- Backed internally by a **bit-vector representation** → extremely fast operations.
- Maintains the **natural order of enum constants** (the order in which they are declared).

---

## Key Characteristics

- **Only for Enums:** Works only with enum types. Cannot store non-enum objects.
- **Ordered:** Elements are maintained in the natural order of enum declaration.
- **High Performance:** All operations (`add`, `remove`, `contains`) run in constant time **O(1)**.
- **Compact Representation:** Uses bits to represent enum constants → memory-efficient.
- **No Nulls:** Does not allow `null` values.
- **Type-Safe:** Ensures compile-time safety (cannot mix enums of different types).

## Internal Working

- Each enum constant corresponds to a **bit position** in a bit vector.
- If the bit is **1**, that enum constant is present in the set.
- If the bit is **0**, it is absent.

Example with enum `Days { MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN }`:

EnumSet containing {MON, WED, FRI}

Bit vector (position = ordinal of enum constant):

Index:   0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Enum:   MON TUE WED THU FRI SAT SUN
Bits:    1   0   1   0   1   0   0

- MON, WED, FRI present → bits set to 1.
- Others absent → bits set to 0.

This design makes `EnumSet` extremely fast and memory-friendly.

## Complexity Chart

| Operation          | Time Complexity | Notes                                          |
|--------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| add(E e)           | O(1)            | Sets the corresponding bit to 1.               |
| remove(Object o)   | O(1)            | Clears the corresponding bit to 0.             |
| contains(Object o) | O(1)            | Checks if the bit is set.                      |
| iteration          | O(n)            | Iterates in natural enum order.                 |
| memory usage       | Very low        | Uses a single bit per enum constant.            |

## Differences vs Other Sets

| Feature              | HashSet                   | LinkedHashSet             | EnumSet                                |
|----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Applicable Types     | Any object                | Any object                | Only enum constants                     |
| Ordering             | Unordered                 | Insertion order           | Natural order of enum declaration       |
| Performance          | O(1) average              | O(1) average              | O(1) (bit-level, fastest)               |
| Memory Usage         | Higher (hash table)       | Higher (hash + linked list)| Extremely low (bit-vector)              |
| Null Handling        | One null allowed          | One null allowed          | Null not allowed                        |
| Best Use Case        | Generic uniqueness sets   | Maintain insertion order  | Work exclusively with enums efficiently |

## When to Use EnumSet?

- When working with **enum constants** and need **fast, memory-efficient Set operations**.
- Useful for representing **states, flags, options, or modes** that come from an enum.
- Ideal when you need to perform **set operations** (union, intersection, complement) on enums.

Examples:
- Representing a set of **days in a schedule**.
- Defining **permissions or modes** in an application.
- Representing **enabled/disabled features** from a list of enums.

## Quick Recap

- **EnumSet** is specialized for enums.
- Internally uses **bit vectors** → fastest and most memory-efficient Set.
- Maintains **natural enum order**, not insertion order.
- Disallows `null`, disallows non-enum objects.
- Best choice when handling sets of enum constants.
