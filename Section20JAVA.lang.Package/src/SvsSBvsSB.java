/*
Java program to demonstrate the difference between, String, StringBuilder and StringBuffer

Concat1: In this method, the string “Geeks” is passed, and we perform s1 = s1 + “forgeeks”
Since String is immutable, a new string is created, and s1 in concat1() points to it.
The original string in main() remains unchanged.

Concat2: Here, s2.append(“forgeeks”) modifies the original StringBuilder object.
Since StringBuilder is mutable, it updates the string directly in main() to “Geeksforgeeks”.
Concat3: StringBuffer and StringBuilder are similar, but StringBuffer is thread-safe due to synchronized methods,
while StringBuilder is not, making it thread-unsafe.

If a string is going to remain constant throughout the program, then use the String class object because a String object is immutable.

If a string can change (for example: lots of logic and operations in the construction of the string) and will only be
accessed from a single thread, using a StringBuilder is good enough.

If a string can change and will be accessed from multiple threads, use a StringBuffer because StringBuffer is synchronous,

so you have thread-safety.

If you don’t want thread-safety than you can also go with StringBuilder class as it is not synchronized

Rule of Thumb:
- Fixed string = String use karo.
- Single-thread modifications = StringBuilder use karo.
- Multi-thread modifications = StringBuffer use karo.
