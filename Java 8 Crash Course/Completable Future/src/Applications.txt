Applications of CompletableFuture in Java:

1. Web Scraping / API Calls
   - Fetch data from multiple APIs (e.g., user details, order history) in parallel.
   - Example: Aggregating weather data from multiple sources.

2. Microservices Communication
   - Handle multiple service calls without blocking the main thread.
   - Example: Fetch user info from Auth Service and purchase history from Order Service.

3. Database Operations
   - Run multiple SQL queries asynchronously.
   - Example: Fetch user profile and recent transactions simultaneously.

4. Machine Learning / Data Processing
   - Process large datasets in parallel.
   - Example: Running image recognition on multiple images concurrently.

5. Stock Market / Financial Apps
   - Fetch live stock prices from multiple sources without delays.
   - Example: Pull stock prices and news sentiment analysis in parallel.

6. IoT / Sensor Data Processing
   - Process data from multiple sensors in real-time.
   - Example: Reading temperature, humidity, and air quality simultaneously.

7. Gaming / AI Bots
   - Compute AI decisions asynchronously for better game performance.
   - Example: AI enemy behavior calculations in a separate thread.

CompletableFuture is ideal for high-performance, real-time, and concurrent applications.
