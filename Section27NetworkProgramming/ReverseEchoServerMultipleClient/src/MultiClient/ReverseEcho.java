            characters, arrays, and lines.
            The buffer size may be specified, or the default size may be used. The default is large enough for most
            purposes.
            In general, each read request made of a Reader causes a corresponding read request to be made of the
            underlying character or byte stream.
            It is therefore advisable to wrap a BufferedReader around any Reader whose read() operations may be
            costly, such as FileReaders and InputStreamReaders.

Terminates connection when the client sends "dne".
