Callback Method in Java:

A callback method in Java is a method that is passed as an argument to another method, and it gets executed at a later time when a certain event occurs or a condition is met.

How Callbacks Work in Java

Since Java does not support passing functions directly (like JavaScript or Python), **callback methods are typically implemented using interfaces, anonymous classes, or lambda expressions.

Example 1: Using an Interface (Traditional Way):

A common way to implement callbacks in Java is by using an interface.

Step 1: Define a Callback Interface:

interface Callback {
    void onComplete(String message);
}

```

Step 2: Implement the Callback Interface:

class Worker {
    void doWork(Callback callback) {
        System.out.println("Working...");
        
        // Simulating work completion
        try { Thread.sleep(2000); } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }

        // Calling the callback method when work is done
        callback.onComplete("Work is done!");
    }
}
```

Step 3: Use the Callback:

public class CallbackExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Worker worker = new Worker();
        
        // Implementing callback using an anonymous class
        worker.doWork(new Callback() {
            @Override
            public void onComplete(String message) {
                System.out.println("Callback received: " + message);
            }
        });
    }
}
```
Output:
```
Working...Callback received: Work is done!
```

---
Example 2: Using Lambda Expressions (Modern Java Approach):

If you're using Java 8+, you can simplify the callback implementation using lambda expressions.

public class LambdaCallbackExample 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Worker worker = new Worker();

        // Using lambda to pass the callback method
        worker.doWork(message -> System.out.println("Callback received: " + message));
    }
}
```

Output:
```

Working...Callback received: Work is done!
```

Real-World Use Cases of Callbacks in Java:

1. Event Handling: Used in GUI applications like Swing (`ActionListener`).
2. Asynchronous Programming: Used in multi-threading (`Runnable`, `Callable`).
3. API Calls & Background Tasks: Used in web services, networking, etc.
