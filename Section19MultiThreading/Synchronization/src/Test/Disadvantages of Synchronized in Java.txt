Disadvantages of `synchronized` in Java:

1. Unfair Locking (No Fairness) ⚖️ – Threads may not get the lock in order, causing starvation.
2. Thread Blocking 🚦 – Even read-only operations must wait, reducing efficiency.
3. No Interruptibility ⏸️ – Waiting threads cannot be interrupted, leading to possible deadlocks.
4. No Read-Write Locking 📖✍️ – Doesn't allow multiple readers, causing unnecessary waiting.
5. Performance Overhead 🐢 – Only one thread runs at a time, slowing down execution.
6. Increased Deadlock Risk 🔗 – If two threads hold locks and wait for each other, they get stuck.
7. No Timeout Handling ⏳ – Cannot set a time limit for acquiring locks.
8. Less Flexibility 🎛️ – No way to check if a lock is already held or try acquiring it conditionally.

Alternatives: Use `ReentrantLock` or `ReadWriteLock` for better control and performance!
