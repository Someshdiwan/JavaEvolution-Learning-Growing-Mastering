/*
Remember - A constructor name should be the same as a class name and must not have a return type(void).
Think of constructors as the birth certificate of an object.
When you create an object in Java, it needs to be initialized with some initial values or properties.
Constructors are used to initialize these properties and prepare the object for use.

Remember - A constructor name should be the same as a class name and must not have a return type(void).

If no constructor is defined in a class, Java provides a default no-argument constructor automatically.
This default constructor initializes the object but doesn't set any properties, leaving instance variables with their
default values (e.g., null for objects, 0 for integers, false for booleans, etc.).
