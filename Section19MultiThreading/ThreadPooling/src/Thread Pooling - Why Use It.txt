Thread Pooling - Why Use It?

Thread pooling is a technique where a collection of pre-initialized threads is maintained to execute tasks efficiently.
Instead of creating and destroying threads repeatedly, thread pooling manages a fixed number of threads that are reused
for different tasks.

1. Resource Management
- Creating and destroying threads repeatedly is resource-intensive.  
- A thread pool manages the lifecycle of threads efficiently, reducing CPU and memory overhead.  

2. Faster Response Time
- Since threads are pre-created, tasks do not have to wait for thread initialization.  
- This reduces latency, making applications more responsive.  

3. Control Over Thread Count
- Prevents excessive thread creation, which can lead to resource exhaustion.  
- Developers can configure the pool size based on available system resources.  

4. Avoids Thread Overhead
- Reduces context switching and excessive CPU usage from too many active threads.  
- Ensures optimal CPU utilization by reusing existing threads.  

5. Useful in High-Concurrency Environments
- Ideal for web servers, database connections, and real-time applications where multiple tasks need execution without delay.
