/*
Summary of Key Points:

Final airBags() Method: This method in the Car class is declared final so it cannot be overridden in the
EVCar class (or any other subclass).

If you want subclasses to be able to override it, you need to remove the final keyword from the method.
Static Constant PI: PI is now a constant in the Car class and is declared final static (constant style).
Naming Conventions: Classes are named using proper camel case (Car instead of car).
EVCar Class: Demonstrates overriding of methods like accelerate() and decelerate(), but it cannot override airBags()
due to the final modifier in the Car class.
