ðŸ”¹ Key Concept:
â€¢	Before Java 8 â†’ interfaces could only have abstract methods.
â€¢	From Java 8 onwards â†’ we can add default methods inside interfaces.
â€¢	Default methods provide a body/implementation inside the interface.

â€¢ Useful for:
âœ” Backward compatibility (adding new methods to existing interfaces).
âœ” Avoiding duplicate code in all implementing classes.

ðŸ”¹ Quick Recap:
âœ” Default methods = methods with implementation inside interface.
âœ” Help in backward compatibility and reducing duplicate code.
âœ” Can be used as is or overridden in implementing classes.
âœ” Static methods are also allowed in interfaces (called using interface name).
