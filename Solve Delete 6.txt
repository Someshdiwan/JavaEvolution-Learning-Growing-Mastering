Certainly! The problem is asking you to implement a grading system for a university where grades need to be rounded based on specific rules. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. Each student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
2. Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade and should not be rounded.
3. For passing grades (40 or higher), if the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round the grade up to the next multiple of 5.

For example:
- If a student's grade is 73, the next multiple of 5 is 75, and since the difference is less than 3, the grade is rounded up to 75.
- If a student's grade is 67, the next multiple of 5 is 70, but the difference is 3, so the grade remains unchanged.
- If a student's grade is 38 or less, it is a failing grade and remains unchanged.

The task is to implement a function that takes a list of grades as input and returns a new list with grades rounded according to these rules.

Here's how you can implement the **gradingStudents** function in Java:

### **Logic Breakdown:**
1. If the grade is **less than 38**, it is a failing grade and should not be rounded.
2. If the grade is **38 or higher**, check the next multiple of 5.
3. If the difference between the next multiple of 5 and the grade is **less than 3**, round up to that multiple.
4. Otherwise, keep the grade unchanged.

### **Java Code Implementation:**
```java
import java.util.*;

public class GradingStudents {
    public static List<Integer> gradingStudents(List<Integer> grades) {
        List<Integer> roundedGrades = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int grade : grades) {
            if (grade < 38) {
                roundedGrades.add(grade);
            } else {
                int nextMultipleOf5 = ((grade / 5) + 1) * 5;
                if (nextMultipleOf5 - grade < 3) {
                    roundedGrades.add(nextMultipleOf5);
                } else {
                    roundedGrades.add(grade);
                }
            }
        }
        return roundedGrades;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int n = scanner.nextInt(); // Number of students
        List<Integer> grades = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            grades.add(scanner.nextInt()); // Read each student's grade
        }
        
        List<Integer> result = gradingStudents(grades);
        
        for (int grade : result) {
            System.out.println(grade); // Print rounded grades
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### **Example Input:**
```
4
73
67
38
33
```

### **Processing:**
- **73 â†’ 75** (next multiple of 5 is 75, difference is 2)
- **67 â†’ 67** (next multiple of 5 is 70, difference is 3)
- **38 â†’ 40** (next multiple of 5 is 40, difference is 2)
- **33 â†’ 33** (failing grade, not rounded)

### **Output:**
```
75
67
40
33
```

This Java program correctly implements the grading rules and rounds the grades accordingly! ðŸš€
