-  Query: A query is a request to retrieve or manipulate data from a database. It can be a simple or complex
   statement written in SQL.

-  Subquery: A subquery is a query nested inside another query. It is used to retrieve data that will be
   used by the main (outer) query.

-  Inner Query: The inner query is the subquery that executes first and provides results to the outer query.

-  Outer Query: The outer query is the main query that uses the result of the inner query to fetch the final data.

-  Nested Query: A nested query is another term for a subquery, as it is placed inside another SQL query.

Subqueries are commonly used for filtering, calculations, or comparisons within the main query. ðŸš€


### Usage of IN, =, and > in SQL  

-  IN â†’ Used when checking if a value exists within a list or the result of a subquery.
   It is useful when expecting multiple possible values.

   Example: Find students who live in any of the given cities.

-  = â†’ Used for exact matches, typically in comparisons with a single value.
   It is used when the subquery or condition returns only one value.
   Example: "Find students whose department number is exactly the same as Smithâ€™s. 

-  > â†’ Used for comparing numerical values to check if one is greater than the other.
   It is used when filtering records based on conditions involving numerical magnitude.
   Example: Find students with marks greater than 50.
