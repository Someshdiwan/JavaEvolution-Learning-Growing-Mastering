generic types allow you to define a class, interface, or method with placeholders(type parameters) for the
datatypes they will work with.

The syntax for a generic type is:

class ClassName<T> {
    // Class body
}

Where T is the type parameter, which can be any valid identifier.

Conventionally, single-letter names are used for type parameters,
such as T for Type, E for Element, K for Key, V for Value, etc.
