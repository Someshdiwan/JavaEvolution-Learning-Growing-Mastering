1. Fairness Issue in synchronized (Unfair Locking):

- What is fairness? It ensures that threads get the lock in the order they request it (first-come, first-served).

- Problem with synchronized:

- It is not fair —a thread that recently released the lock may acquire it again, even if other threads have been waiting longer.
- This can cause starvation, where some threads never get access to the resource.

- Example Scenario:
- Imagine a ticket counter where some customers jump the queue** while others keep waiting.

Better Alternative: ReentrantLock supports fair locking to ensure fairness.

2. Blocking (Threads Forced to Wait):

- What is blocking? If one thread has a lock, all other threads must wait, even if they are only reading data and not modifying it.

- Problem with synchronized:

- It does not distinguish between reading and writing it blocks all threads until the lock is released.
- Even if a thread just wants to **read** shared data (which doesn’t change anything), it still has to wait.

- Example Scenario:
- A library where only one person at a time can enter, even if they just want to read a book, while others keep waiting.

Better Alternative: ReadWriteLock allows multiple readers at the same time while still controlling writes.

3. Interruptibility Issue (Cannot Stop a Waiting Thread)

- What is interruptibility? It allows a thread to cancel waiting for a lock if needed.

- Problem with `synchronized`:

- If a thread is waiting for a lock, it cannot be interrupted.
- If something goes wrong, the thread remains stuck until the lock is available.

- Example Scenario:

- Imagine waiting in a long queue for hours with no way to leave even if you change your mind.
Better Alternative: ReentrantLock.lockInterruptibly() lets you interrupt waiting threads, so they don’t get stuck.

4. No Read-Write Locking (Poor Scalability)

- What is Read-Write Locking? It allows:

- Multiple threads to read at the same time (safe because reading doesn’t change data).
- Only one thread to write, ensuring no conflicts.

- Problem with synchronized:
- It does not differentiate between reading and writing —it blocks all threads.
- Even if 10 threads only want to read, they must wait for each other.

- Example Scenario:
- A library with only one seat, where even if many people just want to read, they must wait instead of sitting together.

Better Alternative: ReadWriteLock lets multiple readers access data, improving performance.
