## 💡 What to Contribute
Helpful contributions include:
- New or improved **Java example files** (`.java`) in the correct section folders.
- Explanatory files (`.md`, `.txt`) accompanying examples.
- Fixes: typos, unclear wording, or broken examples.
- Site improvements under `site/` (Jekyll pages, assets, docs).
- Tests, utilities, or tooling that make examples easier to run.
- Advanced content: concurrency, streams, design patterns, or integration with databases.
- Translations, diagrams, or supplementary learning material.

👉 If you’re unsure where a change belongs, open an issue and label it `help wanted`.

## 🛠️ Getting Started (Local Setup)

Suggested workspace folder name: `Java Se`.

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/Projects/"Java Se"
cd ~/Projects/"Java Se"
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
mkdir "C:\Users\<YourName>\Projects\Java Se"
cd "C:\Users\<YourName>\Projects\Java Se"
```

Clone your fork:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/JavaEvolution-Learning-Growing-Mastering.git
cd JavaEvolution-Learning-Growing-Mastering
```

Add upstream remote:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Someshdiwan/JavaEvolution-Learning-Growing-Mastering.git
```

### ✅ Prerequisites
- Git (latest stable)
- Java JDK (8+ depending on the section) → Check with `java -version`
- Optional: Maven or Gradle
- Optional: Jekyll (if working on `site/`)
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, or Eclipse

---

## 🌱 Branching & Workflow
- Always create a new branch per feature/fix:
```bash
git checkout -b feat/<topic>-short-description
```
- Regularly sync with upstream `main` to avoid conflicts:
```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main   # or `merge` if preferred
```
- Push to your fork:
```bash
git push origin feat/<topic>-short-description
```
- Open a Pull Request against `main` with a clear description.
