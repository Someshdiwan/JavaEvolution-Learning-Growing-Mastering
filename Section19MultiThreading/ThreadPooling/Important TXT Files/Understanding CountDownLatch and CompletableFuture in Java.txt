Understanding CountDownLatch and CompletableFuture in Java:

Both CountDownLatch and CompletableFuture help manage concurrent tasks in Java but serve different purposes.

1️⃣ CountDownLatch:

CountDownLatch is used for synchronization between multiple threads.

It allows one or more threads to wait until other threads complete their tasks.

Key Features:

- Starts with a count (number of tasks to wait for).
- Each time a task completes, the count decreases.
- Once the count reaches zero, waiting threads are released.

Example: Waiting for Multiple Tasks to Finish

import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;

public class CountDownLatchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3); // We need to wait for 3 tasks

        Runnable task = () -> {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " completed task.");
            latch.countDown(); // Reduce count by 1
        };

        new Thread(task).start();
        new Thread(task).start();
        new Thread(task).start();

        latch.await(); // Main thread waits here until count reaches zero
        System.out.println("All tasks completed. Main thread resumes.");
    }
}

Expected Output:

Thread-0 completed task.
Thread-1 completed task.
Thread-2 completed task.
All tasks completed. Main thread resumes.

✅ Use Case: Waiting for multiple tasks to finish before proceeding
(e.g., batch processing, service startup dependencies).

2️⃣ CompletableFuture:

CompletableFuture` is an advanced tool for asynchronous programming.
It allows running tasks in the background, chaining operations, and handling results or exceptions.

Key Features:

- Runs tasks asynchronously without blocking the main thread.
- Supports chaining (thenApply, thenAccept, etc.).
- Supports combining multiple futures (thenCombine, allOf, etc.).
- Provides exception handling (exceptionally, handle).

Example: Asynchronous Computation:

import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class CompletableFutureExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        CompletableFuture<Integer> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            System.out.println("Running async task...");
            return 42;
        });

        System.out.println("Doing something else...");

        Integer result = future.get(); // Blocking call (waits for result)
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }
}

Expected Output:

Doing something else...
Running async task...
Result: 42

✅Use Case: Performing long-running tasks asynchronously (e.g., API calls, database queries).

Comparison Table:

| Feature              | CountDownLatch        | CompletableFuture           |
|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
|  Type                |  Synchronization tool | Async computation           |
|  Blocking?           |  Yes (await())        | No (Non-blocking)           |
|  Parallel Execution? |  No                   | Yes                         |
|  Result Handling?    |  No | Yes             | (chaining & combining)      |
|  Exception Handling? |  No | Yes             | (exceptionally(), handle()) |


When to Use Which?

- Use CountDownLatch when you need to wait for multiple threads to complete before proceeding.
- Use CompletableFuture when you need to perform non-blocking async operations and chain results.
