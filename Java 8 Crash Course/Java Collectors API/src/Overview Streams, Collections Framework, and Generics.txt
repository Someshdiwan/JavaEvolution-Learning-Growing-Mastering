Overview: Streams, Collections Framework, and Generics:

Java Streams
------------
- Declarative Data Processing:
  Functional, chainable operations (filter, map, reduce) instead of verbose loops.

- Back-End Data Manipulation:
  Used in Spring Boot / server apps to filter, transform, and aggregate DB or API data.

- Parallel Processing:
  Execute in parallel → efficient for large datasets and CPU-heavy tasks.

- Event & Log Processing:
  Ideal for pipelines like log analysis, event filtering, and computing summaries.

--------------------------------------------------------

Java Collections Framework
--------------------------
- Core Data Structures:
  Provides List, Set, Map, Queue → backbone of most Java applications.

- Wide Applicability:
  * Back-End: Store DB results, cache business logic data.
  * Front-End (JavaFX/Android): Manage UI states, adapters, and session data.
  * Framework Integration: Heavily used in Spring, Hibernate, and APIs.

--------------------------------------------------------

Generics
--------
- Type Safety:
  Prevents runtime errors by enforcing compile-time checks (e.g., List<String>).

- Reusable Components:
  Enables generic repositories, utility classes, and type-safe APIs.

- Readability & Maintenance:
  Eliminates casting, improves clarity, reduces boilerplate.

- Wide-Ranging Impact:
  * Frameworks/Libraries: Type-safe utilities and collections.
  * Custom Data Structures: Generic classes define clear type contracts.

--------------------------------------------------------

Real-World Applications
-----------------------
- Enterprise Back-End:
  Collections hold DB records, Streams process them, Generics ensure type safety.

- Microservices:
  Aggregate multiple service results with streams; generics provide reusable DTOs and interfaces.

- UI & Mobile Apps:
  Collections manage models, Streams simplify transformations, Generics enforce type checks.

- Utility & Middleware:
  Custom libraries use Collections for data, Generics for flexible APIs.

--------------------------------------------------------

Summary
-------
✔ Streams → Modern, functional data processing.
✔ Collections → Robust, reusable data structures.
✔ Generics → Type safety + reusability.

Together = foundation for efficient, scalable, and maintainable Java applications (front-end & back-end).
