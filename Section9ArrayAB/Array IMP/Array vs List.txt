- Array: A fixed-size, contiguous memory data structure that stores elements of the same type.
  It provides constant-time (O(1)) access to elements via an index.  

- List (ArrayList/LinkedList): A dynamic collection that can grow or shrink in size.
  It is part of Javaâ€™s java.util package and allows flexible manipulation of elements.
 
ArrayList provides fast access, while LinkedList is optimized for frequent insertions/deletions.

Array vs. List in Java:

| Feature               |  Array                                    |  List (ArrayList/LinkedList)                                               |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Size                  | Fixed                                     |  Dynamic (can grow/shrink)                                                 |
| Performance           | Fast access (O(1) indexing)               |  Slower than arrays for indexing (O(1) for ArrayList, O(n) for LinkedList) |
| Memory                | Continuous memory allocation              |  Dynamic memory allocation                                                 |
| Flexibility           | Cannot change size after creation         |  Can dynamically add/remove elements                                       |
| Implementation        | int[] arr = new int[5];                   |  List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();                                   |
| Best For              | When size is known & fixed                |  When frequent insertions/deletions are needed                             |


Use Array when performance and fixed size matter.
Use List when flexibility and dynamic resizing are needed.
