CAS (Compare-And-Swap) is an atomic operation used in concurrent programming to achieve lock-free synchronization.
It allows multiple threads to update a shared variable without using locks, improving performance in high-concurrency scenarios.

How CAS Works?

CAS involves three key components:

Expected Value – The current value of a variable.
New Value – The value we want to update to.
Memory Location – The address of the variable being updated.

Process:

The CAS operation checks if the current value at a memory location matches the expected value.
If it matches, the value is atomically updated to the new value.
If it doesn’t match (i.e., another thread modified the value), the update fails, and the thread can retry.

CAS in ConcurrentLinkedDeque:

ConcurrentLinkedDeque is a non-blocking, thread-safe, double-ended queue.
It relies on CAS operations to update nodes without locking.
CAS ensures that operations like addFirst(), addLast(), removeFirst(), and removeLast() work concurrently without race conditions.

Advantages of CAS:

? Lock-free and non-blocking – Improves scalability in multithreaded environments.
? Avoids thread contention – Unlike synchronized locks, CAS allows multiple threads to attempt updates without blocking.
? Used in Java’s concurrent utilities – Found in AtomicInteger, AtomicReference, ConcurrentLinkedQueue, and more.

Limitations of CAS:

? ABA Problem – If a value changes from A ? B ? A, CAS might mistakenly assume no change occurred. Solution: Use AtomicStampedReference.
? Spin-waiting overhead – If many threads repeatedly fail CAS, performance may degrade.


CAS is a fundamental concept in concurrent programming, enabling efficient, lock-free updates.
It plays a crucial role in Java’s concurrent collections like ConcurrentLinkedDeque, making them highly
scalable and performant in multithreaded applications.
