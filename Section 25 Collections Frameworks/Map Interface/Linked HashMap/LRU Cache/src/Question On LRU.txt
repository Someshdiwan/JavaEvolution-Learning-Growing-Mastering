Basic Understanding:

Can you explain how your LRUCache works?

Why did you extend LinkedHashMap instead of using HashMap?
What does super(capacity, 0.75f, true); do in the constructor?
What is the role of removeEldestEntry?

Edge Cases & Behavior:

What happens if I add more than the defined capacity?
What if I reinsert an existing key? How does it affect the order?
How does accessOrder=true impact element eviction?

Performance Analysis:

What is the time complexity of put() and get() in your implementation?
How does LinkedHashMap internally maintain the access order?
Would your LRU cache work efficiently for large-scale data?

Alternative Implementations:

Can you implement LRU without LinkedHashMap?
How would you design an LRU cache using a doubly linked list + HashMap?
What are the trade-offs between your approach and using a Deque + HashMap?

Code Improvements & Optimization:

How would you make your cache thread-safe?
What if you wanted to store a large number of elements efficiently?
How can we improve memory management in your implementation?
