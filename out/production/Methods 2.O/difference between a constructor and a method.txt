The difference between a constructor and a method in Java is fundamental in object-oriented programming. Let's break down the key differences:

1. Purpose
     - Constructor:
     - A constructor is used to initialize a new object. It is called when an object is created.
     - Its main role is to set up the initial state of the object, such as initializing fields or setting up resources.
   
     - Method:
     - A method is used to define behavior or operations that an object can perform. It can be called after the object is created to perform actions on the object.

2. Name
     - Constructor:
     - The constructor's name must be the same as the class name.
     - For example, in the `Arithmetic` class, the constructor must be named `Arithmetic`.
     
     - Method:
     - A method can have any name (except it cannot be the same as the class name, unless it's a constructor).
     - For example, a method can be named `add`, `multiply`, or `display`.

3. Return Type

     - Constructor:

     - A constructor does not have a return type. It doesn't return anything, not even `void`.
    
     - Example: 
     
       public Arithmetic(int a, int b) { ... }
      
     - Method:

     - A method must have a return type. It can return a value (e.g., `int`, `String`, `void`), or in some cases, it can return nothing (in which case it would have a return type of         
       void).

     - Example:
     
       public int add(int a, int b) { ... }
     
4. Invocation
   
     - Constructor:

     - A constructor is automatically called when you **create an object** using the `new` keyword.

     - Example:
       
       Arithmetic obj = new Arithmetic(10, 20);  // Constructor is called here
       
     -  Method:
     
     - A method is called explicitly after the object has been created, using the object's reference.
     
     - Example:
     
       int sum = obj.add(10, 20);  // Calling the add method
       
5. Parameters:
     
     - Constructor:
     
     - Constructors can take parameters, allowing you to pass values to initialize the object at the time of creation.
     
     - Example:
       
       public Arithmetic(int a, int b) {
           // Initializes the object
       }
       
     - Method:

     - Methods can also take parameters, but they are called after the object is created.

     - Example:
       
       public int add(int a, int b) {
           return a + b;
       }
       
6. Inheritance

     - Constructor:

     - Constructors are not inherited. Each class must define its own constructors, although the subclass can call the superclass constructor using `super()`.
     
     - Method:

     - Methods are inherited. A subclass can inherit methods from its superclass and can override them if needed.

7. Constructor Overloading vs Method Overloading
     
     - Constructor:

     - Constructor overloading is allowed, meaning you can have multiple constructors with different parameters in the same class.
     
     - Example:
     
      public Arithmetic() {
           // Default constructor
       }

       public Arithmetic(int a, int b) {
           // Constructor with parameters
       }
       
     - Method:

     - Method overloading is also allowed, which means you can have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.
     - Example:
       
       public int add(int a, int b) { ... }
       
       public int add(int a, int b, int c) { ... }

|   Invocation            | Called automatically when an object is created   | Called explicitly on an object after creation    |
|   Parameters            | Can take parameters to initialize an object      | Can take parameters to perform an action         |
|   Inheritance           | Not inherited; must be defined in each class     | Inherited by subclasses                          |
|   Overloading           | Can be overloaded with different parameter lists | Can be overloaded with different parameter lists |


Example to Clarify:

class Car {
    private String model;
    private int year;

    // Constructor: Initializes the object with model and year
    public Car(String model, int year) {
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method: Displays the details of the car
    public void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("Model: " + model + ", Year: " + year);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a new object of type Car
        Car myCar = new Car("Tesla Model 3", 2021); // Constructor is called here

        // Calling the method to display car details
        myCar.displayDetails();  // Method is called here
    }
}


Output:

Model: Tesla Model 3, Year: 2021

- Constructor: `new Car("Tesla Model 3", 2021)` initializes the object with the `model` and `year`.

- Method: `displayDetails()` is called after the object is created to show the car's details.
