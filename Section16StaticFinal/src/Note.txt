References vs Objects vs Instances

Person p1 = new Person(); // p1 is a reference, new Person() is an object (instance)

you can create many objects using a single class. each may have unique attributes or values.

static variable(class variable):

Declared using static keyword.
It is also know as a static members variable.
Every instance of class shares static variables.
so if changes are made with that static variables all other instances of that class will see the affects if that changes.

class Counter {
    static int count = 0; // shared by all instances
    Counter() {
        count++; // increases the same shared variable
    }
}

static variables are used for:
1.Storing counters
2.Generating unique id.
3.Storing a constant values that doesn't change like a pi.
4.Creating and controlling access to the shared resources.


static methods & Instances Method:

it is declared using a static modifier.
static methods can't access directly using a instances' method.
and directly also a instances variables.
we can't use 'this' keyword.
