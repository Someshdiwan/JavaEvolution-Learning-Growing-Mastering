/*Printing Output from Functions
A Method can also directly print output to the console using print statements.
        However, this doesn't provide any data back to the caller in a way that can be used elsewhere in the program.
The primary purpose here is to display information, not to provide data for further processing.

Check the example below which gives the same output as the code above:*/

public class FunctionCC5
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        printSquare(5);
    }

    // User-defined method to print the square of a number
    public static void printSquare(int num)
    {
        int squareResult = num * num;
        System.out.println("Square of " + num + " is: " + squareResult);
    }
}
