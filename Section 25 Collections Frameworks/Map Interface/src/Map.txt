Map vs Collection — why the confusion (and the clarification)

Short answer:
Map is an interface, and it is part of the Java Collections Framework, but it does not extend the Collection interface.
That’s the source of the confusion: people conflate “Collections Framework”
(the entire API) with the Collection interface (one branch inside that API).

⸻

Why people get confused
1.	Words collide. The term Collections Framework refers to the whole set of container interfaces and classes in
java.util.

Inside that framework there is an interface literally named Collection.
The names are similar, so it’s easy to mix them up.

2.	Most container interfaces extend Collection. List, Set, and Queue all extend Collection.
Because these common containers are all Collections, many developers assume every container in the
framework must be a Collection. Map is the main (and important) exception.

3.	Similar responsibilities. Map stores groups of objects (key → value),
so conceptually it belongs to the same family of data-structure APIs (add/remove/iterate/etc.),
which reinforces the mistaken belief it extends Collection.

4.	Documentation phrasing. Many guides say “part of the Collection Framework” (correct)
but do not immediately point out “but note: Map ≠ Collection” (missing nuance).

Clear explanation
•	The Collections Framework = the overall library in java.util that provides data-structure interfaces and
	implementations (lists, sets, maps, queues, etc.).
•	The Collection interface is one interface inside that framework.
It is the root of the collection hierarchy (List, Set, Queue).
•	The Map interface is a separate, parallel interface in the same framework.
It models associative containers (key → value). Because its API and semantics differ
(keys and values rather than single elements), it was not made to extend Collection.

So:
Map belongs to the Collection Framework, but Map is not a subtype of Collection. It sits beside it.

Map interface hierarchy (detailed)

Map (interface)
│
├── AbstractMap (abstract class)                 // convenience partial implementation
│   ├── HashMap
│   │   └── LinkedHashMap
│   ├── WeakHashMap
│   ├── IdentityHashMap (special purpose)
│   ├── Hashtable (legacy, synchronized)
│   │   └── Properties                           // subclass of Hashtable for string properties
│   └── SortedMap (interface)                    // note: SortedMap is an interface, see below
│
├── SortedMap (interface)                        // maintains keys in natural or provided order
│   └── NavigableMap (interface)                 // richer navigation API (floor, ceiling, lower, higher)
│       ├── TreeMap                              // red-black tree ordered map
│       └── ConcurrentSkipListMap                // concurrent, ordered map
│
└── ConcurrentMap (interface)                    // concurrency-friendly map operations
    ├── ConcurrentHashMap                        // high-performance concurrent hash-based map
    └── ConcurrentSkipListMap                    // already listed under NavigableMap as well (implements both)

Notes on the hierarchy
•	AbstractMap is a helpful base class that implements many Map methods; concrete implementations like HashMap extend it.
•	SortedMap and NavigableMap are interfaces that add ordering semantics (TreeMap is the usual implementation).
•	ConcurrentMap is an interface for maps designed for concurrent access; ConcurrentHashMap is the primary implementation.
•	Some classes appear in multiple conceptual places because they implement multiple interfaces
(for example, ConcurrentSkipListMap implements ConcurrentMap, NavigableMap, and SortedMap characteristics).

Practical takeaways
•	When you need simple collection semantics (single-element containers, iteration over items): use Collection and
its subtypes (List, Set, Queue).
•	When you need key→value associations: use Map and its implementations (HashMap, TreeMap, ConcurrentHashMap, etc.).
•	Treat Map as a parallel but equally important branch of the Collections Framework — it’s part of the family,
just not a child of the Collection interface.
