1. Applications of Instance Variables:

Instance variables are used when each object needs its own unique data.

Example Use Cases:

1. Object-Oriented Data Storage (Unique Data per Object)
Example: Storing student records, employee details, bank accounts

Each student has a different name and GPA.

2. Modeling Real-World Objects
Example: Car, Book, Animal

Each object has unique properties (e.g., Car has different colors and speeds).

3. Game Development (Player Objects)
Example: Player in a game has health, score, level, etc.

Each player object stores unique stats.

4. E-commerce Systems (Orders and Customers)
Example: Each Order object has different order IDs, customer names, and payment statuses.

5. Banking Systems (Accounts and Transactions)
Example: Each BankAccount object has different account numbers, balances, and holders.
