Wildcards with Generic Interfaces:

You can use wildcards when dealing with generic interfaces to allow for more flexibility with the types used at runtime.

Wildcards allow an implementation to be more permissive about the types of parameters it accepts.

class WildcardExample {
    public static void printContainer(Container<?> container) {
        System.out.println(container.get());
    }
}
Here, the wildcard ? is used, meaning that printContainer can accept a Container of any type.
