/*
You have to write a 2 classes one is subject and students.
you have to write a class for subject and subjID and name and maxMarks and maxobtain.
you have to decide the data type and properties methods and constructers. how many constructer are possible.
data type Should be a string for subID and name also and MaxMarks is Int and MarksObtain is als.
Property methods get method for all of them... what about the set method
maxmarks can change everytime so marksobtain are also use the set method
constructer you can not have non parameterized cons.. subject(sid, name) and subject(",",max marks, marks obtain)
*/
