ðŸ”¹ Benefits of Lambda Expressions:
	1.	Concise and Readable Code
	â€¢	Without lambdas, you usually need anonymous inner classes for functional interfaces.
	â€¢	Lambdas replace that with a few lines of compact code, making it cleaner and easier to read.

	2.	Less Boilerplate
	â€¢	No need to repeat method names, access modifiers, or return types.
	â€¢	Just focus on what the function does, not on all the syntax overhead.

	3.	Improved Maintainability
	â€¢	Shorter, clearer code is easier to debug and maintain.
	â€¢	Reduces clutter from anonymous classes.

	4.	Functional Programming Style
	â€¢	Lambdas bring functional programming concepts into Java.
	â€¢	They let you pass behavior (functions) as arguments, enabling higher-order functions.

	5.	Better with Collections API
	â€¢	Lambdas work seamlessly with the Streams API and Collections framework (introduced in Java 8).
	â€¢	Example: filtering, mapping, reducing collections becomes one-liner operations.

	6.	Encourages Declarative Programming
	â€¢	Instead of describing how to do something (loops, iteration), you describe what you want.
	â€¢	Makes code closer to natural language.

	7.	Supports Parallelism
	â€¢	When combined with parallel streams, lambdas allow simpler parallel processing of data,
	    making multi-core utilization easier.

	8.	Increased Flexibility
	â€¢	Functions can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, or returned from methods.
	â€¢	This was harder before lambdas.
