This example simulates a School Management System, where:

Instance variables store unique student data.
Global (static) variables track the total number of students and school name.

Key Features:
Instance Variables: Each student has a unique name and roll number.
Global Variables: schoolName is shared by all students, and totalStudents keeps track of student count.
Static Method (displayTotalStudents()) prints the total students enrolled.
