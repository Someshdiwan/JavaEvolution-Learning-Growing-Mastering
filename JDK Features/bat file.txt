### ✅ Example 1: A Simple .bat File
This .bat` file prints "Hello, World!" and waits for user input before closing.

@echo off
echo Hello, World!
pause

📌 Explanation:
- @echo off → Hides the commands from being displayed in the console.
- echo Hello, World! → Prints "Hello, World!" in the command prompt.
- pause → Waits for user input before closing the window.

"C:\Users\somes\Downloads\JAVA SE\Section15InnerClasses\src\Main.java"
