Map is an interface, and it is part of the Java Collections Framework, but it does not extend the Collection interface.

Think of it this way: Lists, Sets, and Queues are Collections;
Maps are not Collections, but they are still in the Collection Framework in their own separate hierarchy.

The reason Map does not extend Collection is because their data models are fundamentally different:
•	Collection represents a group of individual elements (like a bag of objects: List, Set, Queue).
•	Map represents a group of key–value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a value.

If Map were forced to extend Collection, its contract would break because:
•	What would size(), iterator(), or contains() mean? On keys, values, or entries?
•	A Map entry is not a single element but a pair, so it doesn’t fit the Collection’s “element-based” model.

That’s why Java designers kept Map in the Collection Framework (to standardize APIs) but
gave it its own hierarchy separate from Collection.

•	Collection = handles single elements.
•	Map = handles pairs of key and value.

That’s why Map couldn’t extend Collection — their contracts are different —
but both are under the Collection Framework umbrella.
