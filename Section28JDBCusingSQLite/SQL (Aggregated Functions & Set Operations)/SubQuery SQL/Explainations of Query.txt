First, we need to find the city where a student named 'Smith' lives.
This is done using a subquery.
The subquery retrieves the city of 'Smith' and passes it to the outer query.

SELECT * FROM students
WHERE city = (SELECT city FROM students WHERE name = 'Smith');

Explanation:
1. The subquery (inner query) executes first: 

SELECT city FROM students WHERE name = 'Smith';
This retrieves the city where Smith is living (e.g., 'Delhi').

2. The outer query then selects all students who live in that city.

3. As a result, all students from the same city as 'Smith' will be displayed.


Meaning of the Query:

The query retrieves all students who belong to the same department (deptno) as Smith.  

Statement:

Find all students who are in the same department as the student named Smith.  

Explanation:

1. The subquery first finds the deptno of Smith.  
2. The outer query then selects all students who have the same deptno.  
3. As a result, all students who share a department with Smith are displayed
