Disadvantages of Synchronization in Java:

Synchronization in Java (`synchronized` keyword) is useful for preventing race conditions, but it has several downsides:

1. Performance Overhead

- Why? Synchronization forces **one thread at a time to access a synchronized method/block.

- Impact:
  - It slows down execution in multi-threaded applications.  
  - If multiple threads are waiting, they get blocked, reducing efficiency.

  - Example:
 public synchronized void method() {
      // Only one thread can access this method at a time
  }

- Even if two threads are reading data (which doesn't require modification), they still wait for each other.

✅ Alternative: Use ReentrantLock for better performance with tryLock().

2. Deadlocks 🛑

- Why? If two or more threads hold locks and wait for each other to release, they get stuck forever (deadlock).

- Example:

  class A {
      synchronized void methodA(B b) {
          b.last();  // Thread-1 waiting for B
      }
      synchronized void last() { }
  }

  class B {
      synchronized void methodB(A a) {
          a.last();  // Thread-2 waiting for A
      }
      synchronized void last() { }
  }

Thread-1 locks A and waits for B, while Thread-2 locks B and waits for A → Deadlock!

✅ Alternative: Use tryLock() with timeouts** instead of synchronized.

3. Reduced Scalability
- Why? Since only one thread can enter a synchronized block at a time,
  it doesn't scale well for high-performance applications.

- Example:
  - If 1000 threads want to read a variable, only one thread at a time can access it.
  - Other threads waste CPU time waiting.
  - Better Approach: Use ReadWriteLock:

  ReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
  lock.readLock().lock();
  try {
      // Multiple threads can read simultaneously
  } finally {
      lock.readLock().unlock();
  }

4. Causes Thread Contention (Blocking Other Threads) 🏋️

- Why? When one thread is inside a synchronized block, other threads **must wait.

- Example: If thread T1 is in a synchronized method, thread T2 can't access it, even if it's just reading data.

✅ Alternative: Use Concurrent Collections  (e.g., ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList) instead of synchronized methods.

5. No Flexibility Compared to ReentrantLock 🛠️

| Feature               | synchronized    |  ReentrantLock             |
|-----------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| Explicit Locking      | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes                     |
| Interruptible Lock    | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes (lockInterruptibly) |
| Try to Lock (Timeout) | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes (tryLock)           |
| Fairness Option       | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes (Fair Lock)         |
| Condition Variables   | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes (await/signal)      |

Example: Using tryLock() to avoid waiting indefinitely:

  ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
  if (lock.tryLock(1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
      try {
          // Critical section
      } finally {
          lock.unlock();
      }
  } else {
      System.out.println("Could not acquire lock, skipping execution.");
  }
  ```

---

### **6. Cannot Control Locking Behavior** 🎛️  
- `synchronized` **cannot check if a lock is already held**.  
- It **cannot allow multiple threads** to read while restricting writes.  
- **Example of an issue:**  
  ```java
  public synchronized void methodA() {
      System.out.println("Thread A");
  }
  public synchronized void methodB() {
      System.out.println("Thread B");
  }

- Even if methodA and methodB don’t access shared data, they still block each other.

✅ Better Approach: Use **`ReentrantLock` with `tryLock()` to check if a lock is available before entering.

Conclusion: When to Use `synchronized` vs `ReentrantLock`?

| **Use  synchronized  when:    | Use  ReentrantLock  when:                    |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Simple critical sections      | Need fine-grained control                    |
| No need for timeout handling  | Need to try acquiring locks with timeout     |
| No need for interruptibility  | Need to interrupt waiting threads            |
| Performance isn't critical    | Need better performance & concurrency        |


- synchronized is easy to use but has performance issues and risk of deadlocks.

- ReentrantLock is more flexible and powerful, offering features like tryLock(), lockInterruptibly(),
and fairness settings.
