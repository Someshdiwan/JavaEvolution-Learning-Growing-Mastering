What is a .sh File?

A .sh file is a shell script used in Linux and macOS.
It contains a series of Unix commands executed by the shell (bash, zsh, etc.).

Key Features of a .sh File:
- Plain text file with .sh extension.
- Must be given execute permission (chmod +x file.sh).
- Runs commands in sequence inside the terminal.
- Used for automation, system tasks, software builds, etc.

Example 1: Simple Hello World
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World from Shell Script!"

Example 2: Open IntelliJ IDEA on Linux
#!/bin/bash
"/opt/idea-IU-2023.3/bin/idea.sh" "/home/user/Projects/JavaTutorials/src/Main.java" &

How It Works:
- #!/bin/bash specifies the interpreter.
- Path "/opt/idea-IU-2023.3/bin/idea.sh" is IntelliJ startup script.
- Second path points to the Java file to open.
- & runs the program in the background.
