Tuple Representation (Linear, Indexed):

Example: ("Alice", 25, "Engineer")

Index:   0        1       2
         |        |       |
Tuple → [Alice] [25] [Engineer]

- Access by index:
  - tuple[0] → "Alice"
  - tuple[1] → 25
  - tuple[2] → "Engineer"

- Fixed size, order preserved.
- Each position has a defined meaning.


Tuple is like an ordered box of slots, accessed by their index, unlike a HashMap which is accessed by keys.
