Detailed Real-World Examples of Thread Safety:

I'll break down **two critical real-world scenarios where thread safety plays a major role, along with solutions.

1. Online Banking System - Preventing Race Conditions:

Scenario:

Imagine a bank account where two users (threads) are trying to withdraw money at the same time.

- Account Balance: $1000
- User 1 (Thread A) wants to withdraw: $800
- User 2 (Thread B) wants to withdraw: $500

- Both threads check the balance at the same time (before the transaction is processed).
- Each sees $1000 and believes there is enough money.
- Both transactions proceed, and the total withdrawal is $1300, even though only $1000 was available.
- Final balance becomes negative (-$300), which should not be possible!

What Went Wrong?
- This is a race condition where multiple threads are accessing and modifying shared data without synchronization.
- The balance check and update should be done atomically (as a single operation).

Solution
- Use synchronization to ensure that only one withdrawal happens at a time.
- Use atomic variables (like AtomicInteger in Java) to ensure thread-safe balance updates.
- Implement database transactions to lock the balance during the withdrawal process.

ðŸ“Œ Real-world example: If you've ever seen a failed transaction message like "Insufficient Funds",
it means the banking system is handling this properly.

2. Ticket Booking System - Avoiding Double Booking**

Scenario: Imagine an online movie ticket booking system where two users are trying to book the last available seat
at the same time.

- User 1 (Thread A) selects the seat at 10:00:05 AM
- User 2 (Thread B) selects the same seat at 10:00:06 AM

- If the system is not thread-safe, both users might be assigned the same seat.
- When they arrive at the theater, both have the same seat number, causing a conflict.

What Went Wrong?

- The system is checking seat availability without properly locking it, leading to double booking.
- The seat allocation is not an atomic operation (it checks and updates separately).

Solution:

1. Use Thread-Safe Collections
   - Use a ConcurrentHashMap or synchronized list to manage available seats.

2. Locking Mechanism
   - When a seat is selected, lock it until payment is completed.

3. Database Transactions
   - Use ACID-compliant transactions in the database to ensure that once a seat is booked,
    it cannot be selected by another user.

ðŸ“Œ Real-world example: If you've ever seen "Seat already booked, please select another" in a booking app,
that's the system handling concurrency properly.


Key Takeaways:

- Thread safety prevents critical real-world issues like double booking and financial errors.
- Race conditions happen when multiple threads modify shared data simultaneously.
- Using synchronization, atomic variables, and database transactions can prevent these issues.
