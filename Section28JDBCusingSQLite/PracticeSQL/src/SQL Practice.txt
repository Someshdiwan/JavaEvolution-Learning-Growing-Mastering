real-world SQL problems:

Scenario: University Database

You have two tables:

ðŸ“Œ students Table

| roll | name   | city       | deptno |
|------|--------|-----------|--------|
| 1    | Smith  | Delhi     | 10     |
| 2    | Vijay  | Kolkata   | 10     |
| 3    | Amit   | Mumbai    | 20     |
| 4    | Priya  | Chennai   | 30     |
| 5    | Rahul  | Pune      | 40     |

ðŸ“Œ dept Table

| deptno | deptname  |
|--------|----------|
| 10     | CSE      |
| 20     | ECE      |
| 30     | Mech     |
| 40     | Civil    |
| 50     | Chemical |

1. Find all students from Delhi
SELECT * FROM students WHERE city = 'Delhi';

2. Retrieve names of students studying in department 10
SELECT name FROM students WHERE deptno = 10;

3. Show unique department numbers (without duplicates)

SELECT DISTINCT deptno FROM students;

4. List students in alphabetical order

SELECT name FROM students ORDER BY name ASC;

5. Count the total number of students

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;

---

Intermediate Level Problems:

6. Find students whose names start with "A"

SELECT * FROM students WHERE name LIKE 'A%';

7. Get the number of students in each department

SELECT deptno, COUNT(*) FROM students GROUP BY deptno;

8. Find students from either 'Delhi' or 'Mumbai'

SELECT * FROM students WHERE city IN ('Delhi', 'Mumbai');

9. Find students NOT from Kolkata

SELECT * FROM students WHERE city <> 'Kolkata';

10. Find students who have a department assigned (`deptno IS NOT NULL`)

SELECT * FROM students WHERE deptno IS NOT NULL;


Advanced Level Problems

11. Retrieve student names along with their department names (JOIN)

SELECT students.name, dept.deptname 
FROM students 
INNER JOIN dept ON students.deptno = dept.deptno;

12. Show departments that have at least 2 students

SELECT deptno, COUNT(*) 
FROM students 
GROUP BY deptno 
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;

13. Find the **top 3 departments** with the most students

SELECT deptno, COUNT(*) 
FROM students 
GROUP BY deptno 
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC 
LIMIT 3;

14. Find students without a department (LEFT JOIN)

SELECT students.name, dept.deptname 
FROM students 
LEFT JOIN dept ON students.deptno = dept.deptno
WHERE dept.deptname IS NULL;

15. Delete students from the 'Civil' department

DELETE FROM students WHERE deptno = (SELECT deptno FROM dept WHERE deptname = 'Civil');

---

Bonus Challenge:
Write a query to find the department with the most students
Retrieve the top 5 students based on roll number, but skip the first 2
