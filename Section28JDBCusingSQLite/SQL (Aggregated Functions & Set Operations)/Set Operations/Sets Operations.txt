Set operations allow you to combine the results of multiple SELECT queries into a single result set.

The most common set operations are:
     UNION: Combines the results of two queries and removes duplicate rows.
     UNION ALL: Combines the results of two queries and includes all duplicates. 
     INTERSECT: Returns only the rows that appear in both queries.
     EXCEPT (or MINUS in some SQL dialects): Returns rows from the first query that are not in the second query.

Important points:
1. Each SELECT statement must have the same number of columns.
2. The data types of corresponding columns must be compatible.
3. The order of rows in the result is not guaranteed unless an ORDER BY clause is used.

Example usage from your commands:
Combining student names from 'Delhi' and 'Mumbai' cities:
       SELECT name FROM students WHERE city = 'Delhi'
       UNION
       SELECT name FROM students WHERE city = 'Mumbai';
This returns a list of unique names from both cities.

When selecting different columns (like name from one query and roll, name from another),
SQLite returns an error because the SELECT statements don't have the same number of columns.
