Real-World Examples of Thread Safety:

1. Online Banking System (Race Condition Example):

Imagine two users trying to withdraw money from the same bank account at the same time:

Thread 1: Withdraws $500 from an account with $1000.

Thread 2: Withdraws $600 at the same time.

If both transactions read the balance simultaneously, they might both think there is enough money, leading to an
overdrawn account.

Solution: The banking system must ensure that only one transaction is processed at a time using thread-safe mechanisms
like synchronization or atomic transactions.

2. Ticket Booking System (Thread-safe Collections):

Suppose multiple users are trying to book the last available seat in a theater at the same time.

If the system is not thread-safe, two users might end up booking the same seat, causing a double booking.

Solution: The ticketing system can use thread-safe data structures like a concurrent queue or synchronized database
transactions to prevent such conflicts.

3. Shared File Editing (Deadlock Scenario):

Imagine two users editing the same file in a cloud-based application.
Thread A locks the file and tries to access the metadata.
Thread B locks the metadata and tries to access the file.

Both threads are waiting for each other to release their locks, leading to a deadlock, where neither can proceed.

Solution: A proper locking strategy (e.g., acquiring locks in a predefined order) ensures that deadlocks don’t happen.

4. E-Commerce Website (Thread-safe Counters):

During a flash sale, thousands of users are adding products to their carts.

If a non-thread-safe counter is used to track the available stock, multiple users might be shown the same last product,
leading to overselling.

Solution: Using atomic operations ensures that each stock update is correctly processed.

Key Takeaways for Interviews:
Thread safety is essential when multiple threads share a resource.
Common issues include race conditions, deadlocks, and data inconsistency.
Solutions include synchronization, locks, atomic variables, thread-safe collections, and immutable objects.
Real-world applications include banking, ticket booking, cloud file editing, and e-commerce.
